SPEAKER_00,26.8,31.859," Do you have on your presentation, do you have so many bullet points you want to cover?"
SPEAKER_01,32.24,33.652," Yeah, like an outline sort of thing."
SPEAKER_00,34.6,34.784, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,35.6,42.499, Would it help to time the deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points?
SPEAKER_01,43.465,44.391, I never thought about that.
SPEAKER_00,45.64,47.918, I don't know how many bullet points you'd have in a presentation.
SPEAKER_00,48.2,49.934, Maybe you'd have 10 or 20?
SPEAKER_01,50.72,51.734," Something like that, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,52.18,53.029, Depending on how long it is.
SPEAKER_00,54.06,71.074," So maybe you, as you start to review a certain bullet point, as you're trying to get it into  your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply and then as you continue  on you just let out that breath really slowly."
SPEAKER_01,71.98,72.878, Like a rhythm sort of.
SPEAKER_00,73.041,73.939," Yeah, I could do that."
SPEAKER_00,74.282,77.599, And then you go to the next bullet point and do the same thing.
SPEAKER_01,78.124,79.132, Never thought about it that way.
SPEAKER_00,80.08,84.918, I'm just thinking it'd be some way to structure so you would get in so many breaths.
SPEAKER_01,85.522,86.714," So I wouldn't forget, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,87.421,88.697," Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit."
SPEAKER_01,88.96,89.205, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,91.286,94.319, Just make sure you keep your bullet points at a length that would work.
SPEAKER_01,94.52,94.928, Right.
SPEAKER_00,95.622,96.275, Not a few paragraphs.
SPEAKER_00,97.091,97.234, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,97.52,102.057, But just a few seconds each so you can get a good deep breath.
SPEAKER_00,102.84,106.419," Or you could, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously several breaths."
SPEAKER_00,106.58,113.019, But just some rhythm that you could kind of grab onto something concrete.
SPEAKER_01,113.851,114.076, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,114.36,119.639," Because I know that in that moment things are probably, like you mentioned, zoning out."
SPEAKER_00,119.921,120.084, Right.
SPEAKER_00,120.86,122.018, It becomes very easy to lose your anchors.
SPEAKER_01,122.446,123.14," Yeah, exactly."
SPEAKER_01,123.261,125.534," And just get really foggy, almost dizzy."
SPEAKER_00,127.383,137.479," Yeah, so if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to  take three deep breaths, that might be something you can really grab onto."
SPEAKER_01,137.84,138.657, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,139.261,144.215, And would kind of cut through that fogginess of something you could still do.
SPEAKER_01,147.119,147.2, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,147.22,150.138, When's the next presentation in that class that's coming up?
SPEAKER_01,150.42,154.416, The next one I believe is next Friday.
SPEAKER_00,155.46,157.876, Is that the next presentation you have in all the classes?
SPEAKER_01,158.56,158.805, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,159.622,159.703, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,160.982,163.114, And that's next Friday.
SPEAKER_00,164.28,168.093," Do you know where you are in the order, like for presenting?"
SPEAKER_01,170.281,171.715, I think I'm actually third in this one.
SPEAKER_00,172.2,172.649, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,173.507,174.16, So not first.
SPEAKER_00,174.282,175.18, Not first.
SPEAKER_00,175.18,176.655, And this one's how many minutes?
SPEAKER_01,177.965,179.234, Like 15 or so.
SPEAKER_00,181.098,181.18, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,181.483,182.935, It's a little shorter than 20 minutes.
SPEAKER_01,183.561,183.929, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,184.58,190.973," So 15 minutes, so you have about a half hour, maybe a little more if there's time to switch  out of kind of sitting there."
SPEAKER_01,192.226,192.471, Right.
SPEAKER_00,193.665,195.397, And potential time where you could be anxious.
SPEAKER_01,195.962,196.146, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,196.86,203.067," But also potential time when you could be reviewing, denotes your bullet points, and  breathing."
SPEAKER_01,203.7,203.782, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,205.101,213.651, And saying to yourself that kind of self-talk that they're not really paying attention to  me anyway.
SPEAKER_01,214.161,214.365, Right.
SPEAKER_00,215.712,215.876, Right.
SPEAKER_00,216.401,220.739, Because that might help reduce that anxiety.
SPEAKER_01,221.043,221.267, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,222.903,226.352, What's one thing you could say to yourself when you're up there?
SPEAKER_01,229.32,233.67, I guess I could say that in general I do pretty well.
SPEAKER_01,237.74,243.955, One bad grade I think going to make me doesn't mean that I don't deserve to be here.
SPEAKER_00,245.86,246.044, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,246.9,249.676, So the self-talk up there could be I deserve to be here.
SPEAKER_01,250.34,251.34, Maybe I've prepared enough.
SPEAKER_01,251.942,255.396, You know that I know that I've prepared and I'm a good student.
SPEAKER_00,256.667,256.769, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,257.361,258.3, I've prepared enough.
SPEAKER_00,258.3,258.79, I'm a good student.
SPEAKER_00,260.046,260.893, I do deserve to be here.
SPEAKER_01,261.84,261.942, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,262.861,263.147, All right.
SPEAKER_00,263.82,268.585, Is that something it would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you  can...
SPEAKER_01,269.34,270.575," Yeah, I think it would actually."
SPEAKER_00,271.02,271.792, You can recite that.
SPEAKER_01,272.26,272.403, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,273.301,274.138, Internally as you...
SPEAKER_01,274.66,276.239," Because it's not long, I think I could."
SPEAKER_01,276.461,281.086, It would be easy to remember and I could just like maybe put it down on one of my note cards  in front of me or something.
SPEAKER_00,283.1,285.15, And how much do you believe that those statements are true?
SPEAKER_01,287.22,290.132," I think, you know, sitting here now I believe them."
SPEAKER_01,292.18,296.158, In the moment sometimes it's a little hard to believe because I convince myself otherwise.
SPEAKER_01,296.54,301.538," But I think I actually believe that that's true, that I do deserve to be in the program."
SPEAKER_00,302.202,302.692, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,303.14,306.878," Those self-talk items, you believe them to be true."
SPEAKER_01,307.564,307.748, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,308.34,313.091," But you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this, you might not believe  them as much."
SPEAKER_01,313.56,313.683, Right.
SPEAKER_00,314.54,317.158," But remember that, you know, we worked on them."
SPEAKER_01,317.991,318.133, Right.
SPEAKER_00,318.46,318.95, You came up with them.
SPEAKER_01,319.48,319.664, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,320.581,322.356, And you believe them now.
SPEAKER_01,323.229,323.392, Right.
SPEAKER_00,323.78,328.039, So try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself.
SPEAKER_01,328.955,329.179, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,329.22,330.006, And you're ready to recite them.
SPEAKER_00,332.001,334.658," It's easy, I realize it's easy to form these plans."
SPEAKER_01,335.124,335.348, Right.
SPEAKER_00,335.94,339.099, But in the chaos of the anxiety and the worry it's harder.
SPEAKER_00,339.34,348.489," So the more tasks you can make concrete and that you can write down and you can rehearse,  I think the better off you'll be."
SPEAKER_01,351.369,351.55, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,352.7,355.938," I would like to see you, your presentations next Friday."
SPEAKER_01,356.22,356.873, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,357.24,362.599," I would like to see you right before that, so it will be about a week before that."
SPEAKER_01,363.41,363.635, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,363.94,366.02, Do you have any questions?
SPEAKER_00,366.02,370.26," These are items you can rehearse still, even without the presentation, the self-talk and"
SPEAKER_01,370.422,370.585, Right.
SPEAKER_00,371.34,372.64, the breathing and of course preparing.
SPEAKER_00,372.921,376.378," But do you have any questions between now and then, do you think?"
SPEAKER_01,377.002,377.553, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01,377.9,378.431, I think it makes sense.
SPEAKER_00,379.492,379.716, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,379.9,382.395, Do you understand kind of the plan to Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,383.3,385.359, attack that anxiety symptom?
SPEAKER_01,385.644,385.848, Right.
SPEAKER_01,387.061,400.557," I think what you kind of suggested before, like maybe practicing my deep breathing, like  maybe now, like when I'm calm and getting into a habit of deep breathing, like I'm more  apt to also remember it then."
SPEAKER_00,401.021,401.327, Right.
SPEAKER_00,402.592,402.837," So, good."
SPEAKER_00,403.101,405.399, So you have some kind of behavioral pieces.
SPEAKER_01,405.846,406.071, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,406.56,406.764, Right.
SPEAKER_00,407.56,413.925," The focus on studying, the breathing and some cognitive pieces, the self-talk we talked  about."
SPEAKER_01,414.66,414.864, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,415.86,418.917, The seated and that you use when you're at the podium.
SPEAKER_01,419.462,419.645, Right.
SPEAKER_00,420.44,422.537, And actually presenting.
SPEAKER_00,423.87,424.295," All right, good."
SPEAKER_00,424.961,426.913, So I'm glad we have a plan going forward.
SPEAKER_00,428.02,434.847, I think that you did a really good job today helping kind of untangle all this and figure  out what's going on.
SPEAKER_00,436.22,444.734, And I appreciate that you were able to really connect with the symptoms and the thoughts  and kind of realize how they're related.
SPEAKER_00,446.02,450.258, And I feel like this is something that's going to serve you well as you move through this.
SPEAKER_01,450.941,451.305, Thank you.
SPEAKER_00,452.82,455.216, So I'll see you in a week.
SPEAKER_01,455.82,456.289," Okay, thanks."
SPEAKER_00,456.862,457.112," Thanks, Hazel."
