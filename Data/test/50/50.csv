SPEAKER_01,128.743,128.906, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,130.16,131.14, How are things done at work?
SPEAKER_00,131.524,132.15, How about at home?
SPEAKER_01,133.782,142.037," Yeah, I mean, so my dining room, I've been like, new china and stuff like that so I've  gotten everything set up."

SPEAKER_01,172.12,192.794," Yeah, well, so on the weekend, I had gone ahead and went shopping and I kind of went  on a shopping spree and I had bought, like I said, my new china and I had gotten some  kitchen utensils too and a couple things for around the house, like home decor."
SPEAKER_01,194.781,198.64, And I called him because I had ran out of space to take everything.
SPEAKER_01,198.68,200.495, I was at the mall so I was hitting a lot of different stores.
SPEAKER_01,201.12,209.394," And I had run out of space to put everything in because I really wanted to actually get  a new dining room set, like tables and chairs and maybe a cabinet."
SPEAKER_01,211.46,220.676," He has an SUV, so I called him to see if he could come and so I could purchase the items,  but he said he wasn't, he couldn't come out."
SPEAKER_01,221.26,233.998," I guess he kind of said he was worried about you spending that much money, which I don't,  you know, I don't know why he would be just from me calling him, but I think that's why  he was concerned."
SPEAKER_01,234.12,234.732, But he didn't come.
SPEAKER_01,235.12,237.356, I didn't get the dining room set or anything.
SPEAKER_00,237.96,239.089, You remember how much you spent?
SPEAKER_01,240.741,246.718," I don't know exactly because there's lots of different stores, but you know, I have  a couple different credit cards."
SPEAKER_01,246.8,251.04, The one credit card I used was declined by the end.
SPEAKER_01,251.12,254.1," So it was probably, you know, I didn't need to get the dining room set."
SPEAKER_01,254.22,257.333," I could have used a different credit card, but obviously it's been enough."
SPEAKER_00,259.2,263.496, Do you feel like you spent more than you usually would spend in a trip to the mall?
SPEAKER_01,265.002,267.12," Well, you know, I never really go on shopping sprees."
SPEAKER_01,267.221,268.858, I never like treat myself like that.
SPEAKER_01,269.04,278.632," So I mean, yes, but I, again, like I haven't, you know, I needed all those things that I  got from my apartment."
