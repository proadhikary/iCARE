SPEAKER_00,21.8,23.131," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,24.24,24.462," Hello, Sarah."
SPEAKER_00,27.409,28.396, How are you doing today?
SPEAKER_01,28.88,29.329, I'm alright.
SPEAKER_00,30.002,30.819, You're alright?
SPEAKER_01,30.88,31.023, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,32.682,42.577, I understand that you've come to counseling because you have a particular issue that's  been bothering you recently.
SPEAKER_01,43.382,45.833," Yeah, I've been really stressed out at work."
SPEAKER_01,47.46,50.414, I'm getting to the point where it's really hard to handle things that are going on.
SPEAKER_00,51.8,53.127, So work-related problems.
SPEAKER_00,55.76,57.329, Are you okay talking about that today?
SPEAKER_01,59.44,60.33," I think I need to, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,61.73,62.24, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,62.24,70.178, So what I'd like to do in the beginning is kind of set a plan for our meeting today.
SPEAKER_01,71.247,71.39, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,72.361,81.814," And we can move off that plan if we need to, but I'd just like to start with that and give  us some structure to what we'll be doing."
SPEAKER_00,83.02,88.139," So first, and this is something I want to co-create with you, right?"
SPEAKER_00,88.381,90.759, So your input is extremely valuable to it.
SPEAKER_00,90.98,93.979, I don't want to just lay it out and we follow it.
SPEAKER_00,94.542,96.799, I want you to be an active part of putting this together.
SPEAKER_00,96.96,100.659," So as I throw out some ideas, let me know if it's something that makes sense to you"
SPEAKER_00,100.962,101.574, or doesn't.
SPEAKER_01,102.37,102.493, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,102.88,109.632, I'd like to start by having you explain in depth kind of what you're going through at  work.
SPEAKER_00,110.14,112.289, And I want to hear that story.
SPEAKER_00,114.96,128.177," Then I'm going to look for some patterns in the way you're thinking and see if there's  something that I recognize and all that, something I can point out that may help you a bit."
SPEAKER_00,129.1,130.39, And we'll get more to that later.
SPEAKER_00,131.7,147.697," And then to kind of, as we wrap up, move toward the end, maybe start getting some ideas of  things you can do between sessions, between now and when I see you next time, that can  help combat these symptoms, make you feel a little better."
SPEAKER_01,148.542,148.828, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,149.42,152.337, Does that seem like a fairly straightforward agenda?
SPEAKER_01,152.862,153.127, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,154.123,155.796, Any changes or anything you'd like to make to that?
SPEAKER_01,156.36,160.058," No, I think as long as you think I can tell my whole story in enough time."
SPEAKER_00,160.823,161.631," Well, we'll see."
SPEAKER_00,163.194,163.5, We'll see.
SPEAKER_01,163.52,163.724, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,165.26,169.117, You just kind of tell me what's going on as you feel comfortable.
SPEAKER_00,169.86,177.256," And don't worry about the agenda, but just know that overall that's kind of what I'm  thinking about for the structure."
SPEAKER_01,177.8,178.617, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,179.167,179.738, All right.
SPEAKER_00,179.94,183.055," And then as we wrap up, we'll set to make an appointment next time."
SPEAKER_00,184.101,186.279," And like I said, we'll end up with some ideas."
SPEAKER_00,186.38,187.128, I hope they can help you.
SPEAKER_00,188.26,192.499, So let's get started with kind of your experience with all this.
SPEAKER_00,192.66,193.831, So tell me about your job.
SPEAKER_01,195.835,196.118, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,196.401,205.98," So I'm a caseworker and, you know, what I do, I usually go into people's homes and,  you know, talk to the families, do inspections, that kind of thing."
SPEAKER_01,206.1,210.399," And, you know, I've been doing it for a while now, not too long, but about five years."
SPEAKER_01,210.66,213.211," And overall, I like my job and everything."
SPEAKER_01,215.3,226.387," But just, you know, something happened at work and it just really kind of, I just feel  like one minute everything was fine and now it just feels like everything's really out  of control."
SPEAKER_01,227.52,233.972," So, you know, I was just, you know, doing my normal job, making reports and everything  like that."
SPEAKER_01,234.48,240.798," And, you know, I made a report about this family that I felt, you know, maybe the children  weren't getting quite what they needed."
SPEAKER_01,240.98,241.936, They seemed malnourished.
SPEAKER_01,242.16,243.393, The house was really unclean.
SPEAKER_01,244.04,249.556," You know, I suspected that the parents were using drugs there and it's just really not  a good environment."
SPEAKER_01,251.544,261.819," And, you know, it turns out that the kids were taken away and, you know, the family,  it just, I'm like really freaked out, you know, maybe the kids aren't doing well."
SPEAKER_01,261.98,263.437, They're away from their parents.
SPEAKER_01,263.8,271.359," Even though it wasn't a great environment, I know that the kids really love their parents  and it's just, it's really, really weighing on me."
SPEAKER_01,271.58,292.42," And it's become kind of like a really big issue at work, I guess, where like everybody  knows about it and, you know, I just feel like I tore this family apart and I don't  know if I made the right decision and I just, it's like, you know, I used to just, I used  to be so confident in what I did and now I just feel like I'm second guessing everything."
SPEAKER_00,292.48,295.536, So this is really stressful on you.
SPEAKER_01,296.481,297.012, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,297.601,310.814," So, you like, so I make sure I understand, you like your job, but this, this dealing  you've had with this particular family and what happened as a result of that dealing  has just really thrown you for a loop."
SPEAKER_01,311.95,312.052, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,312.46,313.338, It's making me not like my job.
SPEAKER_01,313.46,316.86," Like I wake up in the morning and I'm like, I should just pretend I'm sick."
SPEAKER_01,316.9,329.204," I don't want to go, you know, I just feel like, you know, at night I'm more stressed  out, you know, maybe I have an extra glass of wine and I just feel so on edge all the  time."
SPEAKER_00,331.16,333.838, So it's really drastically changed your work experience.
SPEAKER_01,334.22,334.342, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,335.341,341.249," I used to enjoy going to work and, you know, feel fulfilled and now I just feel like I  do not want to go at all."
SPEAKER_00,342.94,345.88," So there's a sense of dread, anxiety."
SPEAKER_01,346.573,346.716, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,347.081,349.455, Do you feel down at all?
SPEAKER_01,350.846,351.839," Yeah, definitely."
SPEAKER_01,351.94,355.24," I think anxiety more so, but I definitely feel down."
SPEAKER_01,355.38,369.298," Like, you know, even on the weekends, sometimes I just wake up and I want to stay in bed and,  you know, I just, I feel like I'm having a good time and then I remember what happened  and it just brings me back to that place and I'm just, I don't like it."
SPEAKER_00,370.105,371.099, It's not a good feeling.
SPEAKER_01,371.222,371.305, No.
