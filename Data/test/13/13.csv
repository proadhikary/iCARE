SPEAKER_01,25.6,36.273," So yeah, it's uncomfortable to talk about because it's just like, I don't know."
SPEAKER_00,42.2,48.391, My sense is that you were trying to say something and then you just kind of almost like gave  up there.
SPEAKER_01,48.84,52.54," Well, I don't know what, I'm trying to talk about it."
SPEAKER_01,52.56,54.872, And I don't know what else like you want me to do.
SPEAKER_01,56.62,59.58, I told you that I'm not feeling like I'm getting something out of the therapy.
SPEAKER_01,59.68,64.415," I feel like I'm being pretty clear, but I guess I'm not."
SPEAKER_00,66.241,67.365, Are you feeling angry at me?
SPEAKER_01,71.94,77.738," I mean, I'm feeling angry that the therapy isn't working."

SPEAKER_00,106.4,108.733," If you are, I really want to know about it."
SPEAKER_01,110.02,120.675," Well, I mean, I guess there is a part of me that's like a little, yeah, a little angry  that you're not helping me."
SPEAKER_01,121.941,124.298, I came as therapy because I wanted to feel better.
SPEAKER_01,125.523,135.393," And yeah, I mean, I guess I am feeling angry that that's not like what I'm getting from  you, even though that's what I'm trying to get."
SPEAKER_00,137.681,141.0," So, yeah, you're sounding really exasperated to me."
SPEAKER_00,141.221,143.037, How does it feel to tell me about this?
SPEAKER_01,143.32,144.632, It feels hard.
SPEAKER_01,145.58,152.378," I mean, I'm, it feels hard to say that I'm angry."
SPEAKER_01,153.16,158.392," It's like not a feel, it's not a comfortable thing to say or not a comfortable thing to  feel."
SPEAKER_01,158.8,164.655," It's just like makes me like, it's not, it's just like, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,166.901,167.269, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,167.86,177.758," So, you know, I don't want to push you too hard, but can you say any more about what  you're, what's uncomfortable about this?"
SPEAKER_00,178.0,180.193," I mean, I do understand that it's uncomfortable."
SPEAKER_01,181.44,187.099," I mean, it's not something I would like ordinarily say to someone that I'm angry at them."
SPEAKER_01,187.36,197.857," So it feels like, I feel like I'm kind of anxious now, like even saying it, like, I  don't want you to think I just like, that it's like your fault."
SPEAKER_01,198.6,202.614," It just like feels like I'm like, that's something I'm really not supposed to say."
SPEAKER_00,204.18,208.633," So I mean, part of it sounds like is you're concerned that I'm going to feel like you're  blaming me."
SPEAKER_01,210.027,211.357," I mean, yeah, I guess."

SPEAKER_01,216.42,216.767, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,220.145,231.133," But it is hard to feel like this, I feel like I'm alone in this therapy that like, I've  been coming here and trying and I'm just not like getting anything from you."
SPEAKER_00,233.082,233.327, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,233.96,235.839," So that, that sounds really important, right?"
SPEAKER_00,235.92,242.897," It sounds like you're, you know, it's hard to say this to me, but you're, you know, you're  feeling angry at me."
SPEAKER_00,243.382,244.618, Maybe you're feeling disappointed.
SPEAKER_00,244.8,245.739, You're feeling all alone.
SPEAKER_00,245.902,246.331, Yeah.
