SPEAKER_00,14.538,15.46," Hey Erica, how are you doing today?"
SPEAKER_01,15.88,16.709," Good, thank you."
SPEAKER_00,17.84,18.344, You're doing good?
SPEAKER_00,20.22,25.218, I was hoping today we could revisit the two chair technique.
SPEAKER_00,25.8,28.793," We used it a few sessions ago, you might remember."
SPEAKER_00,30.54,36.527," I knew in the last session, I felt like we were kind of getting to a point where we identified  a conflict."
SPEAKER_00,37.8,38.657, You know what I'm referring to?
SPEAKER_01,38.94,48.372," What do you mean kind of between part of me that wants to settle down, but then part of  me that also wants to pursue my career and what I'm doing?"
SPEAKER_00,50.44,56.983, So we have a part that wants to settle down and a part that wants to keep going with the  career.
SPEAKER_00,58.98,77.579," So for this two chair, what I'd like to do is in the chair where you're seated now, this  will be the emotional self, in this case the side that wants to pursue the career."
SPEAKER_00,79.303,81.0," From what I saw before, that seems like we're more..."
SPEAKER_01,81.666,82.919," That's what I really want, yes."
SPEAKER_00,83.04,84.878," You're more emotionally connected, that's what you want."
SPEAKER_01,85.04,86.04," Yeah, that's what I want."
SPEAKER_00,86.06,93.418, So this will be the side of you that has the needs and the wants and more the emotion.
SPEAKER_01,94.162,94.754, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,95.121,96.757, So that's who you'll be in this chair.
SPEAKER_00,97.323,98.171, Does that make sense?
SPEAKER_00,99.381,115.519," In the other chair, let's have that critic that's inside, that internal critic that's  advocating for settling down, for getting married, for having kids."
SPEAKER_00,116.221,119.115, In a way it represents a societal pressure.
SPEAKER_01,120.626,121.535, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,122.401,127.496, Do those two sides seem separate to you?
SPEAKER_01,130.047,130.228, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,132.381,137.017, You feel like you can be the emotional self here and the internal critic there?
SPEAKER_01,138.326,138.734, I think so.
SPEAKER_00,139.06,139.141, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,141.121,143.04, So I think you remember how this works.
SPEAKER_00,143.241,147.478," You'll be talking to, in this case, the internal critic."
SPEAKER_00,148.06,151.598," So the internal critic's on the side of settling down, getting married."
SPEAKER_00,152.221,163.96," And then when you're ready to have the critic respond, you'll switch to that chair and respond  to the emotional need-driven and wanting self."
SPEAKER_00,164.754,165.04, Make sense?
SPEAKER_01,165.122,165.611, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,166.877,167.04, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,167.04,172.189," So whenever you're ready, go ahead and speak directly to the internal critic."
SPEAKER_01,179.722,182.813, I want to finish what I'm doing and I want to finish what I started.
SPEAKER_01,185.621,191.735, I've worked so hard on my career path and I'm so close to finishing.
SPEAKER_01,194.06,195.786, And I want to finish for me.
SPEAKER_01,200.04,202.794, I want to accomplish those goals that I've set for myself.
SPEAKER_01,204.702,206.026, It's something I'm passionate about.
SPEAKER_00,211.04,211.999, So you made your statement.
SPEAKER_00,212.101,213.04, Are you ready to switch?
SPEAKER_00,213.04,213.979," Okay, go ahead and switch."
SPEAKER_00,214.06,216.447, So now you're the internal critic.
SPEAKER_01,221.42,237.239," There's always time to pursue a career, but I need to focus on what's expected of me at this time."
SPEAKER_01,238.584,240.315, I'm the best age for having kids.
SPEAKER_01,241.862,248.274, I have a loving boyfriend who is ready and wants to get married and settle down.
SPEAKER_01,251.661,258.554, And you are being selfish by just following a path that you can take at any time.
SPEAKER_00,262.26,271.02," So the internal critic cues in the emotional side, in this case the career side, being selfish."
SPEAKER_00,271.762,277.478, And notice your posture is very linear and you're upright.
SPEAKER_00,278.16,282.217, And notice you kind of put your hand out a little bit when you were talking.
SPEAKER_00,283.441,288.137, Try to think of the internal critic's body movements.
SPEAKER_00,289.1,291.537, Try to act that out a little bit.
SPEAKER_01,292.04,292.14, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,303.101,304.818, I think it's accusations.
SPEAKER_01,307.984,313.993, I just want to tell the emotional part that it's being stupid.
SPEAKER_01,319.08,321.908, You're not acting in the best interest of everyone else.
SPEAKER_01,327.208,328.98, You want to jump at it.
SPEAKER_00,329.04,330.434, You want to jump at the emotional side?
SPEAKER_01,333.758,334.0, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,334.04,335.163, So that's the internal critic.
SPEAKER_00,335.183,338.591,Are you ready to respond back to the internal critic from the emotional side?
SPEAKER_01,342.06,342.224, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,343.241,345.094, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,346.1,350.134," So the internal critic is just called selfish, among other things."
SPEAKER_00,352.04,356.98, This is your response.
SPEAKER_01,357.04,357.904, It feels like I'm being attacked.
SPEAKER_01,361.24,369.474, And I don't think it's wrong to think about myself and what I'm truly passionate about.
SPEAKER_00,373.606,374.212, Let me interrupt you.
SPEAKER_00,375.08,378.492," So your hands, they're pointing back toward the career emotional self."
SPEAKER_00,381.04,386.819, What can you do with your hands that really embody what you want to communicate to the internal critic?
SPEAKER_00,387.04,389.98, Is there anything else you'd want to do?
SPEAKER_00,390.06,396.0, Right now they're pointing toward you.
SPEAKER_01,396.04,405.938, They're pointing towards me to protect myself from what the critic is saying.
SPEAKER_01,407.06,409.355, I just want to push that back towards the critic.
SPEAKER_00,410.04,414.495," When you use that motion, you're pushing the internal critic away."
SPEAKER_01,416.322,416.503, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,419.261,423.834, So I don't need to feel guilty.
SPEAKER_01,426.1,436.132, I don't need to feel selfish for wanting to follow my dreams.
SPEAKER_00,443.04,444.787, Does the internal critic have something to say back?
SPEAKER_01,448.606,448.707, No.
SPEAKER_00,450.203,450.448, All right.
SPEAKER_01,451.04,451.563, I think the critic...
SPEAKER_01,455.081,455.244, I'll try.
SPEAKER_01,456.262,456.505, I'll try.
SPEAKER_00,456.525,456.707,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,458.06,461.554," So you've now pushed the emotional side, pushed the critic away."
SPEAKER_01,463.489,463.693, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,464.28,475.897, And I think the critic feels like it understands where the emotional side of me is coming from.
SPEAKER_01,478.04,498.779," Like I can recognize why it's so important and why working so hard is worth that sense of accomplishment that's going to come with it  and how it's going to, in the long run, help provide for all these extra things that I want to..."
SPEAKER_01,499.221,500.731, like my family in the future.
SPEAKER_01,502.04,502.545, I can see that.
SPEAKER_00,504.1,504.362, All right.
SPEAKER_00,504.423,507.04,So the internal critic is...
SPEAKER_00,507.281,509.291, Now you have your hands down here is the internal critic.
SPEAKER_00,511.942,517.496," Is the internal critic less angry, less assertive?"
SPEAKER_01,519.181,520.919, Less pushy.
SPEAKER_00,521.203,521.673, Less pushy.
SPEAKER_01,522.101,522.367, Less pushy.
SPEAKER_01,523.281,527.679," Yeah, it's not as critical, truthfully."
SPEAKER_01,531.205,539.558, I feel like the pressure isn't weighing on either's shoulders.
SPEAKER_01,539.738,540.219,You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_00,541.561,541.842, All right.
SPEAKER_00,541.862,549.759,"So the critic is more separated now, maybe a little bit, but also has a different outlook."
SPEAKER_01,550.743,551.305, More quiet.
SPEAKER_01,552.169,554.418,It's not like always yelling at me.
SPEAKER_01,555.501,563.075," Because I think it... I mean, sometimes it might still say something, but not in the urgency that it had before."
SPEAKER_00,566.08,569.833, So the critic has lost some of its vigor and determination.
SPEAKER_01,572.428,572.591, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,573.04,573.261, All right.
SPEAKER_00,573.582,577.372,So move back to the emotional and then just face toward me.
SPEAKER_00,580.621,587.998, What have you gained here through your communication back and forth with the internal critic?
SPEAKER_01,589.101,589.727, I feel calmer.
SPEAKER_01,591.901,603.579," I feel like the critic has always been a part of me, but that part of me is more..."
SPEAKER_01,604.982,606.365, It's not as assertive.
SPEAKER_01,606.565,612.156,It's not as intense right now.
SPEAKER_01,612.236,613.258,It's calm.
SPEAKER_01,615.021,627.539," I think that the emotional part of me was able to win the argument, per se, because that's what I want."
SPEAKER_00,628.341,638.399," So at the end of this conflict, after we split into the two parts here, at the end of this conflict is eventually a decision."
SPEAKER_00,640.082,644.03, It's a decision to pursue a career or settle down.
SPEAKER_00,644.952,648.499,Do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision?
SPEAKER_01,649.28,649.501, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,649.821,661.84,"Because I feel like I can stay on... my decision is and has been to stay on my career path, but now I feel less guilty for doing it."
SPEAKER_00,663.042,663.262, All right.
SPEAKER_00,663.303,672.0,"So that's really been your decision all along, but the internal critic was harassing you this whole time."
SPEAKER_01,672.101,672.363, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,673.01,674.0,Harassment is a good word.
SPEAKER_00,674.681,686.78, Today you were able to shove that internal critic back a little and allow that internal critic to see how strong you feel with the decision you've made.
SPEAKER_01,687.04,687.938, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,688.489,689.02, Is that accurate?
SPEAKER_01,689.142,689.652, Very much so.
SPEAKER_00,691.288,692.98, Do you feel it was a helpful technique for you?
SPEAKER_01,693.621,693.861, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,695.324,695.644,I do.
SPEAKER_01,696.846,703.897,I think that separating the two sides helped me realize which one felt stronger.
SPEAKER_00,706.464,707.979, So it was able to give you some clarity?
SPEAKER_01,708.04,708.142, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,709.701,709.982, Great.
SPEAKER_00,710.984,711.245,All right.
SPEAKER_00,711.325,717.94,"Well, let's... I want you to reflect on what's happened here between now and the next session."
SPEAKER_01,718.571,718.877, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,719.881,731.659, I guess kind of a lot happened and it seems like you've gained clarity for your decision and then we'll pick up with the next session and see how things have progressed with...
SPEAKER_00,732.281,739.619, See if that internal critic is still harassing you or if it kind of stays back and if you have more peace with the decision.
SPEAKER_00,740.326,741.04, Does that sound like a plan?
SPEAKER_01,741.367,741.489, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,742.242,742.707, All right.
SPEAKER_00,742.727,743.272,"Thanks, Erica."
SPEAKER_00,743.333,744.04,I'll see you next week.
SPEAKER_01,744.55,744.795, Thanks.
