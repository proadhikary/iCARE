SPEAKER_00,14.218,15.24," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."
SPEAKER_00,15.681,17.234, I hope you find this video useful.
SPEAKER_00,17.96,20.956," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_00,21.76,23.125," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,27.76,31.291, How many times have you gone to work and made a mistake?
SPEAKER_01,34.223,34.611, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,35.401,41.451," I mean, I guess none technically, none that have been something I've gotten trouble for  or anything like that."
SPEAKER_01,42.24,45.28, Sometimes it's hard to tell because you don't always hear from people afterwards.
SPEAKER_01,45.521,51.374," You can't really tell was it a mistake or not, but I guess none that have had any major  consequences."
SPEAKER_00,52.45,52.652, All right.
SPEAKER_00,53.28,58.335," So none, but there might be a few small ones that you just never found out about."
SPEAKER_00,60.141,62.692, So less than a tenth of a percent of the days you go in?
SPEAKER_01,64.68,65.696, Probably.
SPEAKER_00,65.94,66.328, Very small.
SPEAKER_01,67.002,67.92," Yeah, really, really small."
SPEAKER_00,67.92,74.838, So the probability of the statement that you're making being true is pretty low.
SPEAKER_00,75.7,78.413," The statement, the thought rather, that I'm going to make a mistake."
SPEAKER_00,80.0,81.538, Probably not supported by the evidence.
SPEAKER_01,82.261,83.589," Yeah, I guess that's true."
SPEAKER_00,85.44,92.238, So the automatic thought is not accurate and not useful.
SPEAKER_00,94.346,98.109," It's got a couple of strikes against it, but it is the thought you're having, so let's  deal with it."
SPEAKER_00,99.288,100.138, I'm going to make a mistake.
SPEAKER_00,100.28,110.267," So what could you tell yourself as the first part of the adaptive response, which acknowledges  that fear?"
SPEAKER_00,112.02,114.629," That's realistic, that acknowledges that fear of making a mistake."
SPEAKER_01,118.22,121.335, I guess everybody makes mistakes?
SPEAKER_00,122.46,123.167, Everybody makes mistakes.
SPEAKER_00,124.5,126.631," I could make a mistake today, but it's unlikely?"
SPEAKER_00,128.802,129.633, That also be accurate?
SPEAKER_00,130.22,131.628, So everybody makes mistakes.
SPEAKER_00,133.86,135.709," I could make a mistake, but it's probably not going to happen."
SPEAKER_00,137.94,139.274, It's not that I'm going to make a mistake.
SPEAKER_00,139.82,147.016," So you're going to have that automatic thought either way, likely for a while, until you  start to apply these adaptive responses."
SPEAKER_00,147.58,149.61," So this is what we're working on, is your response."
SPEAKER_00,151.8,158.335," So everybody makes mistakes, I could make a mistake, but it's probably not going to  happen."
SPEAKER_00,158.6,167.176," And what could be the next part, which is realistic but also positive, that can help  get you past the reaction of being late in the morning?"
SPEAKER_01,167.92,174.553, I'm a good case worker and I need to do my job so I can help other people and it's going  to be okay.
SPEAKER_00,175.202,176.954," Okay, so there's a few elements in there."
SPEAKER_00,177.94,184.073," It's going to be okay, I need to do my job, I help people, all those are true."
SPEAKER_00,187.5,193.191," So applying, now even as you say this here with me, as you say it's going to be okay  and I need to do my job."
SPEAKER_00,193.86,194.871, What reaction are you having right now?
SPEAKER_01,195.74,207.63," I mean it feels a little better, it's hard to, you know, I still feel like it's dangerous,  I might make a mistake, but I guess it helps a little bit."
SPEAKER_00,210.82,222.38," Can you see yourself being able to, in the moment, and I realize this is difficult, but  in the moment of having that automatic thought, having that worry come in, can you see yourself  applying this self-talk?"
SPEAKER_01,222.44,235.29," Yeah, I think I probably will because now it will be hard to have those thoughts and  not think of you and think, okay, I need to calm myself down a little bit because we've  been talking about it for so long."
SPEAKER_00,236.66,240.399, And you've already used self-talk on your own before you even knew about these strategies.
SPEAKER_01,240.5,241.133," Yep, that's true."
SPEAKER_01,241.982,243.128, And it did help in the past.
SPEAKER_00,245.76,259.815," A lot of the, or I should say some of the effectiveness of this is based on your ability  in that moment to take a step back and follow the training."
SPEAKER_00,261.38,272.453," Just like many professionals, professionals depend on their training to help them make  the correct intervention, correct decision."
SPEAKER_00,273.52,277.299, So think of this kind of like something you've learned in a training.
SPEAKER_00,277.541,280.978," This is a self-talk, it's pre-packaged, it's ready to go."
SPEAKER_00,281.36,282.278, You can even have it written down.
SPEAKER_00,282.681,287.299," It doesn't have to be short, it can be like a paragraph or more if you wanted."
SPEAKER_00,288.104,291.019, And it's a matter of following the protocol.
SPEAKER_00,292.644,295.975," So you have the automatic thought, it's easy to descend into worry and fear."
SPEAKER_00,297.64,304.078," You're just looking to grab a moment in there and apply this treatment, this strategy."
SPEAKER_00,305.645,307.778, Does that make sense?
SPEAKER_00,308.16,319.94," Sometimes it's likely, well most of the time I think you would be able to do this, sometimes  you probably won't."
SPEAKER_00,319.94,322.258, And it's important in those moments to not get discouraged.
SPEAKER_00,323.705,325.091, So you can have a self-talk for that too.
SPEAKER_00,327.16,333.107," And like Dr. Groundy said, it was likely that once in a while I wouldn't be able to  do this."
SPEAKER_01,333.76,334.933," Yeah, it's not going to work every time."
SPEAKER_00,335.802,338.34, Does that make sense?
SPEAKER_01,338.923,340.973," Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."
SPEAKER_00,342.44,347.674," So it's the chaos of life, right, and the chaos of emotions that sometimes interfere."
SPEAKER_00,349.72,357.515," The more times you have success, that seems to be tied with a better chance of improving  and reduction of symptoms."
SPEAKER_00,358.142,360.193, But allow yourself failures as well.
SPEAKER_00,361.46,367.498, It's what I would expect from anybody trying to untangle all these feelings and thoughts.
SPEAKER_00,368.02,373.934, There's not going to be a perfect connection between an automatic thought and applied self-talk.
SPEAKER_00,376.66,378.474, So be easy on yourself as you try this.
SPEAKER_01,379.24,384.968," That makes sense because if you could just flip a switch, I would only have to have one  therapy session."
SPEAKER_00,386.441,387.691, It would be in good shape.
SPEAKER_00,388.72,390.112, So it's a little more difficult than that.
SPEAKER_00,391.04,400.591," But overall, these strategies are fairly straightforward, and you can definitely learn them, and you  can definitely do them."
SPEAKER_00,401.601,403.413, I want you to have that confidence.
SPEAKER_00,404.48,410.709," It's normal to have mistakes occur, and to not always do it as you need to, or as you  want to."
SPEAKER_00,411.38,423.779," But in the end, overall, you should be able to apply them, and actually it will get easier  in the future to develop your self-talk for different thoughts."
