SPEAKER_01,14.198,15.219," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."

SPEAKER_01,18.0,20.936," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_01,21.78,23.13," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_01,24.52,24.682," Hi, Hazel."
SPEAKER_01,26.907,27.795, How are you doing today?
SPEAKER_00,28.442,28.768, I'm okay.
SPEAKER_01,29.74,30.026, Are you okay?
SPEAKER_00,30.924,31.067, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,31.72,41.811," I know when we met last time for your intake, you were concerned about some presentations  that you had to give at school."
SPEAKER_00,43.129,43.211, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,43.68,45.599, Do you want to talk about that today?
SPEAKER_00,46.061,58.613," Yeah, so in school, I am in school for teaching, and we have to give presentations a lot, as  you can imagine, on different things."
SPEAKER_00,60.763,63.394," And so, it's something that's recurring."
SPEAKER_00,64.64,70.139," And what happened was, I gave a really bad one one time."
SPEAKER_01,71.027,72.139, A bad presentation?
SPEAKER_00,72.281,72.505, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,73.24,81.195," I wasn't feeling very well, and I gave, I think I was just really tired from studying  all night, and I gave a really bad presentation."
SPEAKER_00,82.0,95.589," And then, like now, ever since, like when I've tried to give subsequent presentations,  I am just so nervous, and I'm up there like sweating, and like starting to forget what  I'm going to say."
SPEAKER_00,97.12,103.909," And I'm just like a fear of getting up there and having to get a presentation, because  I feel like I'm going to vomit."
SPEAKER_01,106.354,106.719, All right.
SPEAKER_01,106.8,113.359," So was there a time before, like recently, when you had to give presentations?"
SPEAKER_00,113.88,124.32," Yeah, I mean like before and earlier in my, like I'm towards the end of my degree, so  throughout my program I have, I have a lot to do."
SPEAKER_01,124.401,125.128, And how did you do with those?
SPEAKER_00,126.24,126.567, Pretty well.
SPEAKER_00,127.3,131.979," I mean, I consider myself a pretty good student, so normally I do pretty well."
SPEAKER_00,132.2,133.589, It seemed to come out of nowhere.
SPEAKER_01,135.48,143.76," So this presentation that you gave with the, where you received a poor score, maybe just  an isolated incident?"
SPEAKER_00,144.522,151.725," Yeah, like I was saying, I wasn't, I wasn't feeling very well, I don't think, and it really  hasn't happened."
SPEAKER_01,153.88,161.94, But that experience has still led to a lot of anxiety with subsequent presentations.
SPEAKER_00,162.103,162.511, Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_00,163.02,170.385," Like I'm worried about my grades suffering as a result and, you know, how well I'm going  to do."
SPEAKER_01,171.406,171.773, All right.
SPEAKER_01,172.982,179.538," So, would it be okay if we kind of step through the whole process of you giving a presentation?"
SPEAKER_00,180.322,181.433," Yeah, sure."
SPEAKER_01,182.854,183.058, Right.
SPEAKER_01,183.701,193.295," Is, before I start with that, is this something that leads to anxiety, like right now or other  times or really just in that moment when you're presenting?"
SPEAKER_00,194.22,203.757," Mostly it's most intense in that moment and like maybe like leading up to it, like in  preparation that I know that this is going to happen."
SPEAKER_00,204.26,211.736," Like I always know when I'm going to present, like it'll be like, she'll, the teacher will  say, oh, well, you know, you're this Thursday, someone else's next Thursday."
SPEAKER_00,212.44,219.08," So the closer it gets to that event, the more anxious I am, like in anticipation."
SPEAKER_01,219.995,220.24, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,220.84,225.119, So you start feeling anxiety a few days before presentation or?
SPEAKER_00,225.481,228.38," Yeah, I would say a few days mostly."
SPEAKER_01,229.705,233.259, When does it start to get really distressing for you?
SPEAKER_00,233.64,235.44, Like two days before or one day before.
SPEAKER_00,235.782,237.918," Then I'm like, oh my gosh, like, am I ready?"
SPEAKER_00,238.16,239.195, Like what if I mess up?
SPEAKER_00,239.56,240.878," You know, what if I get a bad grade?"
SPEAKER_00,241.02,241.81, All these like what ifs.
SPEAKER_01,242.886,243.131, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,243.66,250.635," So, would it be okay if we step into this process and kind of break down the steps of  the presentation?"
SPEAKER_00,251.125,251.247, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,252.125,252.431, All right.
SPEAKER_01,252.88,258.314," So let's say that you're taking, what's one of the classes you're taking now?"
SPEAKER_00,260.44,261.073, Early childhood.
SPEAKER_01,261.501,262.293, Early childhood.
SPEAKER_01,262.72,269.218, So let's say you have a presentation in that class a few days from now.
SPEAKER_01,270.423,273.22, It's just a normal presentation.
SPEAKER_00,273.362,273.566, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,274.381,275.66, All right.
SPEAKER_01,275.841,279.619, So let's now move to two days out.
SPEAKER_00,280.105,280.574, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,280.86,283.818, Where you would start to feel a little anxiety about it.
SPEAKER_00,284.812,284.934, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,285.22,289.115, What's going through your mind at that two day out point?
SPEAKER_00,290.381,293.558," I would say like, am I prepared enough?"
SPEAKER_00,293.86,299.76," Like did I do enough, you know, to study or to write down?"
SPEAKER_00,300.326,301.014, Did I do enough?
SPEAKER_01,302.029,302.294, All right.
SPEAKER_01,302.64,306.14," So your thought is, did I do enough preparation?"
SPEAKER_00,306.18,306.405, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,307.281,311.539, Which leads to maybe I didn't is what I'm really thinking.
SPEAKER_00,311.82,314.236, Like I'm not prepared enough as I should be.
SPEAKER_01,314.92,315.798, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,315.92,316.675, I'm not prepared.
SPEAKER_01,317.163,317.934, I'm not prepared enough.
SPEAKER_00,318.4,318.706, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,319.746,320.112, All right.
SPEAKER_01,320.6,326.379, So that's the thought you're having about 48 hours before the presentation.
SPEAKER_01,326.741,327.571, I'm not prepared enough.
SPEAKER_00,328.361,328.973, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,330.782,341.157," So kind of thinking about that thought and what happens afterward, do you have a reaction  like any type of emotional affective, we call it affective reaction to that?"
SPEAKER_00,342.02,351.909," So at that point I'm usually like more like anxious, maybe like irritable a little bit,  um, mostly."
SPEAKER_01,353.96,358.097," And that goes substantially unchanged, that feeling for how long?"
SPEAKER_00,358.88,368.478," Um, like the day before it like kind of gets more intense when I'm like nitpicking like,  well, I forgot this or I didn't forget this."
SPEAKER_00,368.82,381.774," And you know, remembering what happened last time when I didn't do so well and worrying  about my grade, like more thoughts pop in my head of things that I forgot or what if  sort of things."
SPEAKER_01,382.141,383.08, All right.
SPEAKER_01,383.402,387.079," So the same type of thought, just more intense."
SPEAKER_00,387.36,387.911, More intense.
SPEAKER_01,389.205,391.739, And the feeling is also more intense.
SPEAKER_00,392.003,392.169, Yes.
