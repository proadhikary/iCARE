SPEAKER_00,27.32,34.101," So you mentioned before that when you wake up in the morning, you don't want to go to  work."
SPEAKER_00,36.26,37.184, What's going through your mind?
SPEAKER_01,41.04,45.987," I'm going to have to, you know, hear what my coworkers have to say about what's going  on."
SPEAKER_01,46.64,47.615, I might make another mistake.
SPEAKER_01,47.98,52.489, Who knows if I'm going to find out that something terrible happened to these kids when I go  back to work.
SPEAKER_01,53.58,55.048, I guess a lot of stuff like that.
SPEAKER_00,57.18,63.699," So looking at the one, I'm going to make a mistake, this kind of connects to what we  were talking about before."
SPEAKER_00,63.821,65.17, This is the uncertainty.
SPEAKER_00,66.74,68.829, You're not sure of your own skills.
SPEAKER_00,71.4,75.694, And you're afraid of an error that's going to be costly.
SPEAKER_00,77.7,81.277," So when you think that thought, I'm going to make a mistake."
SPEAKER_00,82.141,85.216, So this is when you're in bed before you start your day.
SPEAKER_00,85.9,86.647, And you have that thought.
SPEAKER_00,88.02,88.666, What happens right then?
SPEAKER_01,90.241,91.369, I feel more anxious.
SPEAKER_01,92.94,106.094," You know, I think about like what could happen to somebody else if I make a mistake, like  kids going to the wrong home or, you know, not being with their parents when their parents,  you know, were not doing anything wrong."
SPEAKER_01,106.98,114.411, And I just feel really like overwhelmed and it gets hard to breathe and I just want to  go back to sleep and not have to face anything.
SPEAKER_00,116.68,124.818, So there's an emotional consequence and then the behavior is you don't want to get out
SPEAKER_00,125.865,126.028, of bed.
SPEAKER_01,127.383,130.513, I've been late a lot more lately because I have trouble getting out of bed.
SPEAKER_00,132.42,135.116," And when you're staying in bed, are there more thoughts coming up?"
SPEAKER_01,136.441,144.496," Yeah, I mean if I don't go back to sleep, then I have more thoughts like, you know,  well, I need to go to work."
SPEAKER_01,145.02,146.918," If I don't go to work, then I'm going to be late."
SPEAKER_01,147.1,154.456, Then people are going to notice me and they're going to be thinking about what happened and  thinking there's something wrong with me and that she's not good enough to do her job.
SPEAKER_01,155.42,162.596," You know, I don't want people to know how stressed out I am because then they're going  to doubt my abilities just like I do."
SPEAKER_00,166.441,181.478," So this is really weighing on you and you've identified these thoughts that seem to be  connected with feelings that are unpleasant and behaviors that are unpleasant, but also  maybe not useful, that are impeding."
SPEAKER_01,181.981,184.494," Yeah, they're keeping me from getting to work and stuff like that."
SPEAKER_00,185.62,190.134, So we have a reference point for later on as we continue counseling.
SPEAKER_00,192.06,206.457," I'd like to scale this problem, like maybe I'll scale one to ten, where ten represents  feelings that are nearly unbearable, right?"
SPEAKER_00,207.141,209.129, And one not really a problem.
SPEAKER_00,211.66,214.158, How do you feel on that scale?
SPEAKER_00,214.38,215.789, Where do you rate yourself right now?
SPEAKER_01,217.38,219.436," Right now in this moment, probably like a five."
SPEAKER_00,220.708,221.476, That's right around the middle.
SPEAKER_01,221.82,227.332," Yeah, like I'm really stressed out but I'm not, like when I'm in bed, like I can't get  out of bed, that kind of thing."
SPEAKER_00,228.02,231.455, How would you rate yourself when you're in bed before you go to work?
SPEAKER_01,232.62,233.166, Probably like an eight.
SPEAKER_00,234.38,235.526, Is that as bad as it gets?
SPEAKER_01,238.5,243.177," With this feeling, it's about as bad as it gets, maybe sometimes it gets to a nine."
SPEAKER_01,244.08,248.998," You know, I still feel like I can function but it's really, really difficult."
SPEAKER_00,252.62,255.155," So an eight, sometimes a nine, and right now five."
SPEAKER_00,255.94,258.298, So still not feeling great.
SPEAKER_01,258.661,258.702, No.
SPEAKER_00,260.442,270.135," And if you had to pick an emotion that was standing out above the rest, in the anxiety,  sadness, sense of dread, what would be the worst right now?"
SPEAKER_01,271.34,272.686," Right now, probably anxiety."
SPEAKER_00,276.02,280.759," So a five, on a scale of one to ten, that anxiety should be standing out more."
