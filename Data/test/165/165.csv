SPEAKER_01,91.5,93.448, They always put me in timeouts.
SPEAKER_01,93.649,94.874,I'm really pressured.
SPEAKER_00,96.4,98.38," Victor, are you going to calm down?"
SPEAKER_01,98.481,99.511, I will not calm down.
SPEAKER_00,100.4,103.199," Victor, if you don't stay in your seat, I'm going to have to call security."
SPEAKER_01,103.48,104.203, I never yell.

SPEAKER_00,123.561,128.34, So I'm going to give you a prescription for an antidepressant medication.
SPEAKER_00,129.606,132.4, Can you bring it home to your mom and show it to her and then get it filled?
SPEAKER_01,133.246,133.809, I'll take that.
SPEAKER_01,133.83,135.4,It's none of your business.
SPEAKER_00,136.062,142.219," Okay, so I'm just going to go to my computer and put it in and then my receptionist will print you off the medication."

SPEAKER_00,177.251,177.291,Hi.
SPEAKER_00,179.253,181.515,I'm a psychiatrist.
SPEAKER_00,182.136,183.617,Do you know what a psychiatrist is?
SPEAKER_01,183.637,183.677,No.
SPEAKER_00,184.899,186.04,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,186.56,194.859," So a psychiatrist is a doctor who deals with people who are feeling sad or mad, different feelings that they might have."
SPEAKER_00,195.661,200.557, We'll talk for a little bit and we'll talk about some things that might have been difficult in your life over the past little bit.
SPEAKER_00,201.42,205.155," And our goal is to try to make things, see how we can make things a little bit easier for you."
SPEAKER_01,206.706,206.91, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,207.42,207.645, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,208.4,212.029," When I'm at school, I feel like they're not doing anything."
SPEAKER_01,212.049,216.119,They're not listening to me about how my feelings are.
SPEAKER_00,216.4,217.329, So you feel pretty unheard.
SPEAKER_01,218.741,220.285, I feel unheard at school.
SPEAKER_01,221.068,224.277,My parents and my sister are hearing me.
SPEAKER_00,225.4,226.646, So you said you've been feeling pretty sad.
SPEAKER_00,226.807,228.335,How long have you been feeling sad for?
SPEAKER_01,230.48,234.965," Well, there's one teacher."
SPEAKER_01,234.985,242.735,"I won't give out any names, but she doesn't listen to me."
SPEAKER_01,242.975,243.375,Okay?
SPEAKER_01,244.056,247.4,She just tries to keep me down.
SPEAKER_00,247.984,249.373, How long have you had this teacher for?
SPEAKER_01,250.862,255.079, About four years.
SPEAKER_00,255.4,255.681, Four years.
SPEAKER_00,255.982,259.677,So have you been feeling sad for this entire four years or a shorter period of time?
SPEAKER_01,260.905,262.299, Shorter period of time.
SPEAKER_00,262.42,265.4," So has it been a couple weeks, a couple months, a couple days?"
SPEAKER_01,266.044,266.809, A couple months.
SPEAKER_00,268.4,275.4," So Victor, I want to tell you some of my thoughts of what I think is going on, but I want to invite your sister in because I need to find out a little bit about your medical history."
SPEAKER_00,275.521,278.4," So I'm just going to get her and then I'll come back, okay?"
SPEAKER_01,278.89,279.237, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,281.161,292.639," So I've been talking to Victor and he's been telling me about how he's had less interest in things, he's having trouble sleeping, he's feeling sad all the time."
SPEAKER_00,293.882,298.4, And it does sound like he's been suffering from what we call a major depression.
SPEAKER_00,298.42,302.095, And there's a couple of treatments that I want to talk about.
SPEAKER_00,302.115,303.4,Do you know what medications Victor is on?
SPEAKER_02,303.842,307.035," Yeah, so I actually brought a list because there's quite a few."
SPEAKER_02,307.356,308.36,I can certainly give you all.
SPEAKER_00,308.584,309.053, Thank you.
SPEAKER_00,309.52,316.38," Okay, so on this list it says about sort of what medical illnesses he's had and hospitalizations and surgeries as well."
SPEAKER_00,316.5,319.427, There's a couple of treatments for depression.
SPEAKER_00,320.108,325.36,One is medication and one is also doing some interventions within the school and within the family.
SPEAKER_00,327.125,332.119," And there's a lot of things to think about, but it seems like things in the school have been really not going well."
SPEAKER_00,332.741,336.376, And that's been a major contribution to his sadness.
