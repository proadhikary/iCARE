SPEAKER_00,18.68,18.902," Hello, Kathy."
SPEAKER_00,24.031,24.995, How are you doing today?
SPEAKER_01,26.281,26.567, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,27.464,27.75, You okay?
SPEAKER_00,28.64,35.0," I know when you spoke last time, you had some goals that you want to talk about this time."
SPEAKER_00,35.402,36.187, Are you ready to do that?
SPEAKER_01,38.321,38.933," I need to, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,39.3,39.443, Yeah?
SPEAKER_00,41.226,41.871, What do you have in mind?
SPEAKER_01,43.32,52.16," I just keep thinking about losing this weight and I just, I really want to do it."
SPEAKER_01,52.36,54.875, I just can't get there and I don't know why.
SPEAKER_00,56.007,56.64, So you're frustrated.
SPEAKER_01,56.762,57.64, It's so ridiculous.
SPEAKER_01,58.06,58.407, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,59.705,61.56, Frustrated trying to lose the weight.
SPEAKER_00,61.66,67.694," Now you had said before that you had a specific number of pounds in mind, specific amount  of weight to lose."
SPEAKER_00,68.503,69.49, Do you still have that in mind?
SPEAKER_01,70.941,71.696,I would like 20 pounds.
SPEAKER_00,72.125,72.39,20 pounds.
SPEAKER_01,73.543,79.013," I mean, I would like more, but I've tried to do more in the past and I don't even get  past a couple of days."
SPEAKER_01,79.56,82.814,"So if I can do 20, that would be great."
SPEAKER_00,84.771,84.955, Right.
SPEAKER_00,85.76,87.951, What have you tried before and what do you think got in the way?
SPEAKER_01,90.847,91.794, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,94.004,95.409, I guess it wasn't convenient.
SPEAKER_01,98.78,104.68, I want to do it and it means a lot for me and my family.
SPEAKER_01,104.801,106.498, I think I'd be a lot healthier.
SPEAKER_00,106.68,107.326, It's important to you.
SPEAKER_01,108.843,108.925, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,110.341,114.737," But just like something always gets in the way, you know, and then I lose focus."
SPEAKER_01,115.7,118.338, I'm not very good at staying focused on stuff like that anyway.
SPEAKER_01,119.19,119.435, So.
SPEAKER_00,119.843,120.047, All right.
SPEAKER_00,120.68,122.18, So loss of focus.
SPEAKER_00,122.22,125.835, So you start trying to lose the weight and your focus gets disrupted.
SPEAKER_01,127.12,135.699," And I forget and then I make, you know, spaghetti casserole for six people and then I eat a  lot of it and that's carbs and cheese and fat."
SPEAKER_01,136.22,139.979," And then I, you know, we'll eat what my kids don't eat."
SPEAKER_01,140.281,143.858," And then it's just like, I forget that I'm supposed to be making healthy choices."
SPEAKER_00,145.049,145.675, All right.
SPEAKER_00,146.461,157.478," So you know how to lose weight and you know you can lose weight, but your focus is a little  off when you're trying and that's causing the problem."
SPEAKER_01,157.94,158.403, I think so.
SPEAKER_01,160.88,161.305, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,162.68,172.536,Could we break that goal of losing 20 pounds down into smaller units like say five pounds?
SPEAKER_01,174.8,178.418," Do you think, well maybe."
SPEAKER_01,179.167,179.412, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,180.983,186.358," Um, cause I've never, I always just keep like the chunk of weight, you know, ahead of me."
SPEAKER_01,187.24,189.099, I don't break it into smaller income.
SPEAKER_01,190.251,191.079, It's not my work.
SPEAKER_01,191.72,195.157," I mean, I don't know how I'd have to stay on top of it though."
SPEAKER_01,195.74,196.851, Weigh myself every day.
SPEAKER_00,198.205,199.215, Is that something you can do?
SPEAKER_01,202.863,203.496, I'm so busy.
SPEAKER_01,203.72,204.149, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00,205.245,206.215, Or once a week.
SPEAKER_01,208.821,210.094, I probably do once a week.
SPEAKER_01,210.74,212.356, Put a sticky note somewhere or something.
SPEAKER_01,213.104,214.72," You know, maybe."
SPEAKER_01,214.842,215.7, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,215.76,216.932," I mean, I want to try."
SPEAKER_01,217.841,219.296, I'm going to say yes cause I want to try it.
SPEAKER_00,221.746,225.24, So you mentioned the loss of focus is one problem.
SPEAKER_00,225.322,226.118, How about motivation?
SPEAKER_00,226.24,231.628, Do you feel motivated to move through all those steps like five pounds and five pounds  and so on?
SPEAKER_01,234.018,234.24, Right now?
SPEAKER_01,234.26,234.464, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,236.043,241.019," I think I would need something to keep me going, you know, week to week."
SPEAKER_00,243.248,245.758, A little bit of something extra to help you stay motivated.
SPEAKER_01,246.301,246.648, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,248.843,257.337," Sometimes when your kid does their homework early and you can give them a special treat  for dessert, that helps keep it going."
SPEAKER_00,257.76,258.229, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,259.381,276.179, So some sort of activity or item that you enjoy that you could reserve for when you  reach that goal of say the first five pounds.
SPEAKER_01,277.504,277.749, Right.
SPEAKER_01,278.953,279.076, Right.
SPEAKER_01,279.28,283.959," I would love, I mean, I'm just, I've been so embarrassed, you know, lately."
SPEAKER_01,284.28,291.476," So I feel like I just, if I can find something that keeps me motivated, that would be great."
SPEAKER_00,293.749,294.117, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,294.42,304.795, Do you have a activity or item in mind that we could put in place as something you could  reward yourself with?
SPEAKER_01,306.103,307.537, Like after the first five pounds?
SPEAKER_00,308.184,309.537," Well, there's a few ways we could do it."
SPEAKER_00,310.024,310.596, We could do that.
SPEAKER_00,311.021,315.8, So you reach five pounds and then you can give yourself that reward.
SPEAKER_00,316.121,322.31, Or it could be for something you do every day if that day you're successful in eating  the way you want to eat.
SPEAKER_00,323.483,324.547, What do you think would motivate you more?
SPEAKER_01,328.123,329.537, Maybe something every day?
SPEAKER_00,329.8,329.984, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01,331.102,334.237," So I remember, you know, I just get so distracted by other stuff."
SPEAKER_01,335.32,342.932, There was something every day that maybe I put out almost like a goal at the end of the  day or something.
SPEAKER_00,343.34,343.871, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,344.461,346.092," You know, if I made the right choices."
SPEAKER_00,347.741,358.959," Yeah, so you know each and every day as you're trying to lose weight, you're aware when that  day comes to a close if you had a successful day or a less than successful day."
SPEAKER_01,359.912,360.116, Right.
SPEAKER_00,360.84,369.498," If you had a successful day, then you could engage in an activity or receive an item that  we work out in advance that you know would motivate you."
SPEAKER_01,369.86,370.391, Right.
SPEAKER_01,370.84,374.719," And that could be, you know, maybe watching like a favorite TV show."
SPEAKER_00,375.738,375.84, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,376.081,381.391," You know, because I don't watch TV at night because I'm so busy, you know, cleaning up  and everything."
SPEAKER_01,382.182,385.84, Maybe I could just take some time for myself because I did something good.
SPEAKER_00,386.35,386.554, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01,386.921,388.295," You know, and just watch a TV show."
SPEAKER_00,389.33,389.84, All right.
SPEAKER_00,390.905,392.118, So let's do that.
SPEAKER_00,393.182,402.228," On a day, you know, toward the evening when you know you have had a successful day, by  what time would you know in the evening?"
SPEAKER_01,404.36,405.976, Probably as I'm preparing dinner.
SPEAKER_01,406.44,419.507," If I prepare a good dinner or if I prepare fun food for my kids but I don't eat it, like  chicken nuggets and french fries and stuff, I would know, you know, maybe by like six  or seven."
SPEAKER_00,420.201,420.282, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,421.16,421.874, Let's say seven.
SPEAKER_01,422.221,422.405, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,423.16,423.802, So by seven p.m.
SPEAKER_00,424.564,430.204,"at that point, in terms of the day being successful or less than successful,  you know."
SPEAKER_01,431.327,431.469, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,432.0,432.143, Right.
SPEAKER_00,433.02,433.735, By seven p.m.
SPEAKER_00,433.755,434.0,you're aware.
SPEAKER_00,434.0,445.996," And at that point, if you have met your goal, then you have a TV show that you maybe have  recorded on the TV or something you would watch."
SPEAKER_01,446.6,447.478, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,448.823,451.736," And if you were not as successful, you would."
SPEAKER_01,452.682,452.967, Right.
SPEAKER_00,454.805,459.54, So it'd be like something to keep you motivated throughout the day because you really want  to watch that show.
SPEAKER_01,459.56,459.682, Right.
SPEAKER_01,460.721,461.386, It'd be a lot of fun.
SPEAKER_00,463.58,474.112," You think that structure, that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation  to have successful days through this process?"
SPEAKER_01,476.501,476.869, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,478.36,480.511," I'm not a fan of it, honestly, but it would probably beat the way I feel right now."
SPEAKER_01,482.641,488.435," Anything's kind of better than carrying this, this frustration around."
SPEAKER_01,490.54,493.88, So I'm willing to try anything and I'll try to remember.
SPEAKER_01,494.241,501.156," Like I said, I'll write it down, you know, have it in the kitchen, have it on a note  at seven p.m."
SPEAKER_01,501.38,503.198," You know, how did I do today?"
SPEAKER_00,504.461,507.859," Yeah, this is something you could also track, right?"
SPEAKER_00,507.96,514.135," You could write down days that were successful, days that were less than successful, and we  could look at if there's any patterns."
SPEAKER_00,514.66,523.16," Maybe weekends are harder, weekends are easier, you know, or something where we can identify  days that have maybe more triggers or where you're less motivated."
SPEAKER_01,523.462,526.238," Yeah, I didn't think about that because, right, every day would be different."
SPEAKER_01,526.968,527.213, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,527.56,535.639, There's a potential for every day to be different with what you're exposed to and what temptations  in terms of different foods or what your schedule is like.
SPEAKER_00,535.84,537.388," Maybe if you're busier, it's easier."
SPEAKER_00,539.761,545.48, So we can look at those different patterns and we can add levels to this plan.
SPEAKER_01,545.886,546.09, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,546.6,550.36," But for now, we'll go with the TV show that you'll watch sometime after seven."
SPEAKER_00,550.781,556.919," So at seven, you'll evaluate how you did, and then sometime after that, watch the show."
SPEAKER_01,557.24,557.403, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,558.24,558.706, That's like a plan?
SPEAKER_01,559.88,562.098, So that's leading up to the five pounds.
SPEAKER_00,562.38,562.544, Right.
SPEAKER_01,563.38,563.768, Right.
SPEAKER_01,564.442,564.666, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,565.544,566.36, That's just day by day.
SPEAKER_00,566.727,566.891, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,567.36,570.153,Take this in five pound increments four times to get to your goal of 20 pounds.
SPEAKER_01,571.842,572.352, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,573.189,573.331, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,574.064,575.198, Does that sound good?
SPEAKER_01,576.107,576.996," So far so good, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,577.44,582.299, We'll give that a shot and we'll take a look at the pattern that emerges.
SPEAKER_00,582.68,584.079," So record everything, right?"
SPEAKER_00,584.16,585.058, So write everything down.
SPEAKER_01,585.242,585.466, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,586.16,590.038, So you'll see around seven is a good time when you know what kind of day you had.
SPEAKER_00,590.44,597.186, Write down kind of what happened that day and whether you had success or not and bring  that in.
SPEAKER_01,597.941,598.207, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,599.023,599.88, I'll see you again in a week.
SPEAKER_00,599.88,602.957, So that'll give you seven days to work with.
SPEAKER_01,603.44,604.134, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,604.44,608.459, And we'll look at that log of events and we'll reevaluate each week.
SPEAKER_01,609.044,610.174, So I could start tonight?
SPEAKER_00,610.76,611.678, Start tonight.
SPEAKER_01,612.107,612.536, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,612.944,613.393, All right.
SPEAKER_00,613.76,615.039, All right.
SPEAKER_00,615.161,616.916, So we'll give that a shot and I'll see you in a week.
SPEAKER_01,617.402,617.83, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,618.428,618.725, Thanks.
SPEAKER_00,619.32,619.34," Thanks, Kathy."
