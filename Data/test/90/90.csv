SPEAKER_01,16.986,18.157," Eh, how are you?"
SPEAKER_00,18.863,19.891," I'm okay, thanks for asking."
SPEAKER_00,21.201,27.833, I see that you have signed a release so I could talk to your mother and that she brought  you in today.
SPEAKER_01,28.241,29.078, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,29.261,29.996, What's going on there?
SPEAKER_01,30.502,33.778," Um, you know, they think I have a drinking problem."
SPEAKER_01,34.363,34.853, My family.
SPEAKER_00,35.281,36.715, Your family thinks you have a drinking problem?
SPEAKER_01,37.28,55.478," Yeah, so what really started this was this past weekend, um, they came to pick me up  for my cousin's bridal shower and, uh, I was drunk when they came to get me so I couldn't  go and now everybody's pretty pissed at me so here I am."
SPEAKER_00,56.06,58.099, So they asked you to come into the agency?
SPEAKER_01,58.4,63.513," Yeah, you know, I don't want them to all hate me or anything so I agreed to come."
SPEAKER_00,66.56,69.017, Do you believe that you have a drinking problem?
SPEAKER_01,70.609,71.717, I mean I like to drink.
SPEAKER_01,72.522,75.697," I don't, you know, I think it's okay."
SPEAKER_00,76.461,77.278, You think it's okay?
SPEAKER_01,77.482,78.318," Yeah, I like it."
SPEAKER_01,78.604,79.318, I like drinking.
SPEAKER_00,79.822,83.396," Come on, do you mind if I ask you a few questions today to your drinking?"
SPEAKER_01,84.501,85.207," Oh, that's fine."
SPEAKER_00,87.121,90.515, So how often do you drink now?
SPEAKER_01,92.503,96.919," Um, pretty much every day I would think."
SPEAKER_01,98.627,100.498, I drink every day on the weekends for sure.
SPEAKER_01,101.06,109.716," Um, but like, uh, during the week I'll go to the, whatever the best local happy hour  is, you know, I'll just go about what's going on."
SPEAKER_01,110.702,113.297, So I'll go after work and have some drinks.
SPEAKER_00,115.203,115.971, How about on the weekend?
SPEAKER_01,117.482,125.294," On the weekend I kind of keep to myself, you know, um, so I'll drink a little for whatever  I have at the house."
SPEAKER_01,125.92,133.011," But yeah, I don't really go out a lot on the weekend, mostly to stay at home and, you know,  drink whatever I have there."
SPEAKER_00,134.763,137.615," And how much are you drinking, let's say on the weekend?"
SPEAKER_01,139.443,141.835," Um, it's hard to keep track I think."
SPEAKER_01,144.582,150.797, I'd say a couple cases over maybe like two or three cases of beer throughout the weekend.
SPEAKER_01,152.723,160.812," If there's something on sale, you know, at the liquor store down the street, I'll get  like a bottle of vodka or something to go along with it."
SPEAKER_00,163.242,164.329," Alright, how about during the week?"
SPEAKER_01,166.04,175.256," Um, during the week I just stay at the bar for a few hours, maybe have like six or seven  drinks, and then go home."
SPEAKER_01,176.383,177.913," I mean, I'll have a glass of wine when I get home."
SPEAKER_00,179.181,181.835, Are you drinking more than you want to?
SPEAKER_01,184.563,187.377," Um, I guess so."
SPEAKER_01,188.782,199.977," I mean, I've kind of tried to make a plan to just stay on the weekends to drink some,  and that hasn't really kept up because I like to go to the happy hours and stuff."
SPEAKER_01,201.369,201.532, So.
SPEAKER_00,202.566,203.92, So you've tried to cut down before and...
SPEAKER_01,203.92,204.879," I have, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,205.022,205.593, ...are not able to.
SPEAKER_01,206.443,208.598," Yeah, it's not really happening though."
SPEAKER_01,208.96,209.869, I don't really see it happening.
SPEAKER_00,211.182,212.43, Do you have cravings for alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,214.925,217.88," Um, yeah, you could say so."
SPEAKER_01,217.94,226.437," Well, yeah, when I'm at work I want to drink, and when I'm out doing stuff I want to drink."
SPEAKER_00,228.94,233.097," Are you using exclusively alcohol, or are there other drugs involved?"
SPEAKER_01,234.222,236.9," Um, right now just alcohol is legal."
SPEAKER_01,237.161,242.86," I was inpatient a couple times for cocaine, but I've stopped that."
SPEAKER_01,242.94,245.658," It's not really something I want to do anymore, so."
SPEAKER_00,246.102,247.556, When was the last time you were inpatient?
SPEAKER_01,248.622,253.599," Um, about four months ago, five months ago."
SPEAKER_00,254.002,254.92, Four or five months ago?
SPEAKER_01,254.94,255.083, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,257.724,260.86, And at that time you used cocaine?
SPEAKER_01,261.766,263.376," Yeah, I was using coke and alcohol."
SPEAKER_00,264.287,264.696, And alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,264.961,265.328, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,266.647,267.92, And why did you stop using cocaine?
SPEAKER_01,269.725,271.92," Um, well, I graduated from college."
SPEAKER_01,272.361,283.92," I was kind of a partier in college, and then I had to get a job, and it's kind of, I had a fear of losing my job because of the cocaine, and I had to get a drug test and stuff, so that's kind of in the back of my mind with that."
SPEAKER_01,284.883,289.719," So, yeah, I think the treatment helped with that."
SPEAKER_00,290.465,291.395, Do you crave cocaine?
SPEAKER_01,292.665,294.839," Um, no, mostly just alcohol."
SPEAKER_00,295.104,295.879, Just alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,295.94,296.247, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,299.261,300.965, How about your work?
SPEAKER_00,301.045,306.078,Are you having any trouble keeping your job or your performance at your job been okay?
SPEAKER_01,307.241,313.739," Um, I think I'm not doing tip-top of what I could be doing, but, you know, it hasn't really been a problem."
SPEAKER_01,314.321,322.74," I haven't been threatened to be fired or anything like that, but, you know, I'll come and leave every once in a while, but I sneak in, so nobody knows."
SPEAKER_00,324.021,324.242, All right.
SPEAKER_00,324.543,327.498,Any social problems because of the alcohol use?
SPEAKER_01,329.324,332.471," Um, me with my family kind of right now, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,332.491,335.238,I'm not really getting along with them very well.
SPEAKER_01,336.401,344.92," Um, my friends, though, when I go out with them during the week, we get along fine, but, you know, they're just not really as fun as they used to be, so sometimes..."
SPEAKER_00,344.92,345.777, Your friends?
SPEAKER_01,347.14,353.593," Sometimes they want to do stuff and go to the movies or whatever, and they get a little mad because I don't want to go."
SPEAKER_01,353.774,356.299,"I'd rather go, you know, party somewhere."
SPEAKER_00,357.001,358.779, So you're having some social problems.
SPEAKER_01,358.94,359.165, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,360.363,362.88," Not so much with your friends a little bit, but more with your family."
SPEAKER_01,362.96,363.971," More with my family, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,365.1,372.118," I mean, I guess my friends aren't that happy with me, but I don't think it's a huge deal."
SPEAKER_01,373.901,387.379," My best friend, I haven't talked to in a couple days because she, uh, she was mad at me for not coming to dinner with her the other night because I would rather frank, and she didn't want to do that, so..."
SPEAKER_00,388.94,390.738, So there have been some problems with the...
SPEAKER_01,391.042,391.92," Yeah, I guess so."

SPEAKER_01,406.188,413.86,"I mean, I've fallen down the steps, but I'm not going, like, skydiving or anything, you know, so..."
SPEAKER_01,413.92,421.8," I mean, I did sprain my ankle a couple months ago because I fell down the steps, but other than that, I've been okay."
SPEAKER_00,424.262,436.92," Do you find that, um, you have any exacerbation of symptoms that you have already, like any medical or mental health problems made worse by the alcohol?"
SPEAKER_01,436.92,439.86," No, I would say I'm pretty healthy."
SPEAKER_00,440.002,440.757, Yeah?
SPEAKER_01,440.94,441.818, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,444.242,454.68, So... did you notice a point after you started drinking when you had to increase the amount that you drank to get the same effect?
SPEAKER_01,454.961,455.267," Oh, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,455.961,456.92, When did that happen?
SPEAKER_01,459.862,462.827," Um... I think I kind of go through phases with it, you know."
SPEAKER_01,463.848,470.72,"I'll drink a certain amount for a little while, then I'll notice, you know, I'm not even drunk anymore, so... I'll have to drink some more."
SPEAKER_00,471.201,472.485, When was the last time you noticed that?
SPEAKER_00,472.505,476.559,When you noticed you had to drink a lot more to get the same effect?
SPEAKER_01,477.401,492.7,"I'd say, like, last weekend, you know, I was, uh, drinking a couple beers at my house and a few hours had passed and I drank probably, like, 10, 12 beers and I wasn't feeling anything, so..."
SPEAKER_01,493.502,497.639," I started drinking a little faster and then I started, you know, feeling a little better."
SPEAKER_00,500.105,500.968, How about withdrawal?
SPEAKER_00,501.551,503.92,Do you have any symptoms of withdrawal when you stop drinking?
SPEAKER_01,503.92,503.961, Uh...
SPEAKER_00,506.954,507.9," Like physical symptoms, anxiety?"
SPEAKER_01,510.125,513.86," Well... I mean, I want some more, for sure."
SPEAKER_00,514.124,514.655, Craving?

SPEAKER_01,518.92,519.655," Yeah, so..."
SPEAKER_00,521.02,527.92," Alright, Jackie, are you open to seeing a counselor here at the agency?"
SPEAKER_01,527.92,531.92," Uh... I think that's what my mom really wants, so..."
SPEAKER_01,531.96,536.86," So maybe I'll try it out once or twice and see what happens, but..."
SPEAKER_01,536.92,537.927," I guess to make her happy, I will."
SPEAKER_00,539.92,541.9," Alright, so you want to try it out?"
