SPEAKER_01,21.867,22.636, The thing with the cops.
SPEAKER_00,23.887,25.177, You had some involvement with the police?
SPEAKER_01,26.243,28.595, I was so blown out of proportion.
SPEAKER_01,29.641,30.6,Stupid neighbours were having a party.
SPEAKER_01,30.6,31.6,And I'm trying to be asleep.
SPEAKER_01,31.906,32.6,"It's like 10-11, you know, I'm trying to wind down. They're having a party."
SPEAKER_01,32.6,33.6,"I go over there, yell at the door. Yell through the door, yo, I'm trying to be asleep, bring it down some."
SPEAKER_01,33.661,34.58,No response.
SPEAKER_01,34.641,35.58,"So, I let myself in, with a little force, but I let myself in."
SPEAKER_01,35.6,36.6,They're all up. 
SPEAKER_01,51.923,53.176, I just confront who's ever there.
SPEAKER_01,53.6,54.388, Who's having this party?
SPEAKER_01,55.6,57.499," Everybody's just like, everybody's ignoring me."
SPEAKER_01,57.841,61.978," So, I just go over, take the stereo, open the window, throw it out the window."
SPEAKER_01,62.962,64.795," Then, there may have been people walking by."
SPEAKER_01,65.681,67.358, This woman swear she was walking by.
SPEAKER_01,67.741,69.352," Says, I almost, said, I almost hit her."
SPEAKER_01,70.701,72.176," But to me, she called the cops."
SPEAKER_00,73.184,74.452," So, what story were you on?"
SPEAKER_01,75.763,76.6, Maybe third floor.
SPEAKER_00,77.008,77.437, Third floor.
SPEAKER_00,78.6,82.319," So, you threw the stereo out the window and it landed on the ground?"
SPEAKER_01,82.641,83.314, It did not.
SPEAKER_01,83.6,84.549, It was nowhere near that woman.
SPEAKER_01,85.62,88.278," She was way across the street, but she says, I almost hit her."
SPEAKER_01,88.743,89.355," So, whatever."
SPEAKER_00,89.947,90.6," So, she called the?"
SPEAKER_01,91.085,92.277, She called the police.
SPEAKER_01,92.661,94.196," Said, I was out of control."
SPEAKER_01,94.7,99.259," And then, the people from the party had a nerve to go down when the cops got there."
SPEAKER_01,99.6,100.314, And they agreed with her.
SPEAKER_01,100.6,103.217," They said, I came, they said, I broke him, but I just came in."
SPEAKER_01,103.6,105.378," But anyway, they said, I threw the stereo out."
SPEAKER_01,105.6,109.56," And then, the police are threatening to put me in jail and they're threatening to press charges."
SPEAKER_01,109.741,112.655," And now, it's just ugly, but it's blown out of proportion."
SPEAKER_00,113.822,115.055, You feel it's blown out of proportion?
SPEAKER_01,115.6,115.743, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,116.6,118.075, Has anything like this happened before?
SPEAKER_01,120.63,122.057, Not with the police or anything.
SPEAKER_00,123.021,127.516, How about anything where you found your anger kind of strong?
SPEAKER_01,129.204,130.533," Well, maybe."
SPEAKER_01,131.62,133.297, There was the time it was my daughter.
SPEAKER_01,133.6,133.947, She's 16 years old.
SPEAKER_01,134.661,135.559, You know how teenagers are?
SPEAKER_01,135.6,136.145, They don't listen.
SPEAKER_01,137.6,138.6, She wasn't listening.
SPEAKER_01,138.6,141.379," She has a smart phone, brand new smart phone she got for Christmas."
SPEAKER_01,141.721,144.499," You know, out of my money from my pocket."
SPEAKER_01,145.731,146.6," Brand new smart phone, got for Christmas."
SPEAKER_01,146.62,146.903, I'm up here.
SPEAKER_01,149.489,150.6," Hello, it's time for your homework."
SPEAKER_01,150.6,151.58, Did you do your homework?
SPEAKER_01,151.883,153.317, She's just gabbing on the phone.
SPEAKER_01,153.702,154.6, Not listening.
SPEAKER_01,154.761,157.331," I took the phone, threw it out the window."
SPEAKER_01,160.09,160.6," Broke, shattered."
SPEAKER_01,160.6,160.702, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,162.131,162.376," But, psh."
SPEAKER_00,163.902,166.036, And how long ago was this with the phone?
SPEAKER_01,166.6,167.58, Four or five months ago.
SPEAKER_00,167.781,168.687, Four or five months.
SPEAKER_00,170.947,171.478, All right.
SPEAKER_00,171.6,175.857, So do you find that you're angry often?
SPEAKER_01,177.587,179.499, I wouldn't say I'm angry often.
SPEAKER_01,180.324,189.978," I just think is if people did what I wanted them to do,  what I wanted them to do it, I wouldn't be so upset as much."
SPEAKER_00,190.661,192.317, So you find yourself upset on occasion?
SPEAKER_01,192.841,196.114," On occasion, but again, it's just if people would listen."
SPEAKER_01,197.802,200.518," Like, I don't know if it was last year or the year before,  I don't know when it was."
SPEAKER_01,201.123,206.6," Like, it was one of those Thanksgivings and just my whole family's around,  you know, Thanksgiving, watching football."
SPEAKER_01,206.761,209.54," I'm cooking dinner, you know, busy all in the kitchen."
SPEAKER_01,209.6,210.6, Everything's hot and whatnot.
SPEAKER_01,211.203,213.796, I've got this whole gourmet meal made.
SPEAKER_01,215.003,219.418," My brother's there, his family's there, you know,  my husband's family's there, everybody's there."
SPEAKER_01,220.64,221.59," Everybody, it's time to eat."
SPEAKER_01,223.327,224.216," Everybody, it's time to eat."
SPEAKER_01,224.6,226.56, They think this football game is more interesting than my food.
SPEAKER_01,226.6,227.273, I spent all day making this.
SPEAKER_01,228.001,235.176," So it's like, you know, just went, took the TV,  thought about throwing it at my brother."
SPEAKER_01,235.6,236.069, He's 45 years old.
SPEAKER_01,236.6,237.6," He should be listening, you know."
SPEAKER_01,237.801,240.258," But just threw it on the ground, smashed it."
SPEAKER_01,241.105,241.913, Now you will listen.
SPEAKER_01,242.802,244.6," I stood there, screamed for a little bit, got it all out."
SPEAKER_01,244.943,245.853, I felt so good to get it out.
SPEAKER_01,246.6,248.815," I stood there, screamed, they're all staring, but they ate."
SPEAKER_00,251.6,256.257, Do you feel like you planned to throw the TV  or just something came up in the moment?
SPEAKER_01,256.6,257.233, It just happened.
SPEAKER_00,257.743,257.927, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,258.7,263.58," I'm not planning or anything, but I just want them to eat, you know."
SPEAKER_00,264.903,266.337, It was more of a spur of the moment thing.
SPEAKER_01,267.004,268.58," A spur of the moment, completely a spur of the moment."
SPEAKER_00,269.886,270.192, All right.
SPEAKER_01,270.763,271.457, But it got their attention.
SPEAKER_01,272.192,272.518, They ate.
SPEAKER_00,273.761,276.499," It got their attention, the TV, it had been broken."
SPEAKER_00,279.131,279.294, So?
SPEAKER_00,280.523,288.519," All right, so this has, your anger and some of your behaviors  caused some recent trouble with the law."
SPEAKER_00,288.6,289.559, That's why you're here.
SPEAKER_01,290.204,292.56," Everything, like I said, is blown out of proportion."
SPEAKER_01,293.244,295.459," There's no need for police, no need for the courts or anything."
SPEAKER_01,295.641,296.478, It's like...
SPEAKER_00,297.825,301.52, But now they're involved and you feel like counseling might be helpful.
SPEAKER_01,303.186,304.358," If I want to keep my job, yes."
SPEAKER_01,304.947,305.6, I can't go to jail.
SPEAKER_01,305.903,307.6," I'm like, I can't face any charges."
SPEAKER_01,307.906,308.518, I can't do that.
SPEAKER_01,309.103,311.217, So counseling would be helpful in that regard.
SPEAKER_00,312.151,312.437, All right.
SPEAKER_01,312.6,313.457, But I don't see it as a problem.
SPEAKER_00,315.661,317.479, You don't see the anger as a problem?
SPEAKER_01,317.62,317.927, Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_01,318.964,320.196, I don't see what everybody's talking about.
SPEAKER_01,320.923,322.539, My husband says I have these anger issues.
SPEAKER_01,322.62,325.097, My kids say I throw a tantrum like a two-year-old.
SPEAKER_01,325.983,328.499," But I don't see, I don't see it."
SPEAKER_00,328.682,329.376, You're just not seeing it?
SPEAKER_01,329.6,330.09, I don't see it.
SPEAKER_00,330.661,331.376, All right.
SPEAKER_00,331.921,337.6," Do you have any history of medical problems, mental health problems?"
SPEAKER_01,337.722,338.049,Nuh-uh.
SPEAKER_00,338.741,340.418, You ever use drugs or alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,341.273,341.355, No.
SPEAKER_00,341.641,342.151, Nothing like that?
SPEAKER_01,342.62,343.355, Clean as a whistle.
SPEAKER_00,343.641,344.559, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,345.142,349.48, So it seems like you are open to the idea of counseling.
SPEAKER_00,350.024,351.6, I'd like to get you scheduled with one of our counselors.
SPEAKER_00,351.701,354.077, I'll get you in a couple days if that works.
SPEAKER_01,354.641,355.151, That'll work.
SPEAKER_01,356.307,357.055, It's gonna have to work.
SPEAKER_00,357.943,359.539, I appreciate you answering these questions.
SPEAKER_00,359.66,362.419," This has been helpful, and I'll get you set up with the counselor."
SPEAKER_01,362.886,363.294, All right.
