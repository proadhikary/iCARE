SPEAKER_01,20.753,21.098," Good, good."
SPEAKER_00,21.2,25.617, Your brother brought you in today and he had some concerns about your mood.
SPEAKER_01,26.32,31.537, I mean he has but it's kind of weird because it's actually been great.
SPEAKER_01,32.522,33.438, It's been great.
SPEAKER_01,34.23,34.575, It's been great.
SPEAKER_01,35.12,50.8," I used to have issues with mood but I don't anymore and now I just, for the last couple  days at least, maybe about a week, I don't know I haven't been paying attention but I  have felt awesome."
SPEAKER_01,51.042,52.21, I've gotten so much done.

SPEAKER_01,62.92,66.753," I was thinking about at work this week, I thought I was so proud of myself."
SPEAKER_01,68.76,80.818," Firstly I got a promotion and also I was happy with that but then another one of my coworkers,  he had his birthday so I was like, oh let me do something nice for him and I went home  and I baked him a cake."
SPEAKER_01,81.221,91.278," But it was kind of annoying because when I got there he got mad, which is stupid, because  he said, he didn't appreciate the fact that it said over the hill but he's like old."
SPEAKER_01,91.74,94.156, So I thought it would be funny but it wasn't apparently.
SPEAKER_01,94.82,98.053," But so, yeah besides that this week's been awesome."
SPEAKER_01,99.62,112.56," Like I said I got my promotion and I made a lot of money with a nice increase I should  say and I just, yeah so I've been feeling awesome, getting a lot done."
SPEAKER_00,113.803,120.999," Yeah, I feel like you're getting a lot accomplished at work and at home and what types of things  have you been doing?"
SPEAKER_01,121.06,123.179, So there's a couple projects at work that I've been working on.
SPEAKER_01,123.722,124.646, I got all those done.
SPEAKER_01,127.941,138.039," And I, at home I have been working on unpacking because I moved in kind of a while ago but  I still have boxes sitting around and stuff."
SPEAKER_01,138.12,140.08, So I got that all taken care of.
SPEAKER_01,140.12,141.127, I'm completely unpacked.
SPEAKER_01,142.84,153.376, Over the weekend I went and bought some home decor stuff so it really makes my house look  just like I want it to look and I'm happy with it.
SPEAKER_00,155.283,156.307," Alright, so your mood is up."
SPEAKER_00,159.04,162.152, Your brother specifically had concerns about spending money.
SPEAKER_01,164.381,167.719, I mean he's worried because I went on a shopping spree.
SPEAKER_01,167.92,174.046, So he doesn't really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I didn't really  want to tell him.
SPEAKER_01,175.641,177.217, I might actually because I'm proud of myself.
SPEAKER_01,177.62,181.833, I deserve it and I've worked so hard for so long at this company.
SPEAKER_01,184.12,186.596, So with the shopping spree I was kind of like treating myself.
SPEAKER_01,187.481,189.753, And so I went out and I did spend a lot of money.
SPEAKER_01,191.321,194.44, I actually maxed out one of my credit cards but I don't have a lot of bills right now.
SPEAKER_01,194.621,197.837, I paid off all my debts and I finished paying off my student loans too.
SPEAKER_01,198.38,200.075, So I could pay for it.
SPEAKER_01,200.6,201.893, So that's why he's worried.
SPEAKER_01,202.64,215.678, And I called him because I ran out of space in my car and I was going to try to put this  table that I was going to buy on top of my car but it didn't have one of those things  to attach it.
SPEAKER_01,216.166,217.078, So it didn't work out.
SPEAKER_01,217.22,221.079, And so I think he kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much.
SPEAKER_01,221.722,225.919, But I returned that item because obviously I couldn't fit it in my car and he couldn't  come help me.
SPEAKER_01,225.98,226.808, But besides that I've been fine.
SPEAKER_00,229.103,234.639, Alright so you haven't gotten any trouble at work or at home or anything?
SPEAKER_01,235.003,235.758, No not at all.

SPEAKER_01,258.38,258.829, Yes and no.
SPEAKER_01,259.923,263.5, I mean yes because I haven't really been sleeping as much as I used to.
SPEAKER_01,263.6,268.939, I think I used to sleep too much but like I haven't needed to this week.
SPEAKER_01,270.551,271.5, But it hasn't been an issue.
