SPEAKER_00,21.8,23.125," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,27.52,35.278, Was the feeling itself the worry about not being prepared interfere with preparing?
SPEAKER_01,36.001,36.224, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,37.481,38.532, It's really hard.
SPEAKER_01,39.24,44.377," So like when I'm in the middle of being worried, it's really hard for me to focus."
SPEAKER_01,45.3,57.696, So I can't focus on like what I need to do because I feel like my mind is on a lot of  different things and I can't focus on exactly what I should be doing.
SPEAKER_01,59.0,62.619, It's just like I'm worried about all the different aspects.
SPEAKER_00,63.784,67.92," Alright, so your ability to concentrate through the hard work of preparing."
SPEAKER_01,68.02,70.918," Yeah, to like focus my energy on the right things."
SPEAKER_01,71.321,73.212, I'm just like wasting time worrying.
SPEAKER_00,76.503,90.198," Alright, so this excessive worrying and all this interfering of preparing, all this goes  on right up until you're getting ready to present?"
SPEAKER_01,90.64,92.994," Yeah, and then like while I'm presenting."
SPEAKER_00,94.08,94.733, So let's talk about that.
SPEAKER_00,95.12,98.06, Let's go into the actual day of presenting.
SPEAKER_00,98.08,100.04, So we have this excessive worry coming in.
SPEAKER_00,100.201,101.897, It's interfering with your ability to prepare.
SPEAKER_00,102.28,103.212, It's distressing for you.
SPEAKER_00,105.545,109.418," Now it's what in class, these presentations are in class."
SPEAKER_01,109.86,110.146, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,111.143,112.253, So you're in the classroom.
SPEAKER_00,113.0,118.003," Do you, are you the only one to present during that class or does it rotate through several  people?"
SPEAKER_01,118.921,119.975, It depends on the presentation.
SPEAKER_01,120.36,125.497, Sometimes there's like one or two other people that have to present that night depending  on like how long the topic is.
SPEAKER_00,126.302,131.399," Alright, well let's use the last time you present in that class as a tempo."
SPEAKER_00,132.27,132.76, What was the order?
SPEAKER_00,132.981,134.55, Like what order did you go in there?
SPEAKER_01,136.28,143.572," The one, well the one that I really messed up I think I was first, but usually like I'm  like second maybe."
SPEAKER_00,144.2,147.556," Okay, so for this example let's say you're the second."
SPEAKER_00,148.5,155.118, So you're sitting in the classroom and another student is presenting.
SPEAKER_00,156.04,156.931, What's going through your mind then?
SPEAKER_01,157.681,160.48, I feel like I am totally zoned out.
SPEAKER_01,160.62,167.089, Like I'm not even paying attention to what that person is saying because I'm so worried  about how I'm going to mess it up.
SPEAKER_01,168.96,179.76," You know, I'm starting to like be sweaty, like my hands are clammy, my heart's starting  to race a little bit and I'm just totally zoned out on what they're doing."
SPEAKER_01,179.98,185.558, I'm just you know worrying about what's going to happen when I get up there.
SPEAKER_00,186.74,201.2," Alright, so in that moment as you're seated you're not really watching their presentation  as much because you have these strong, or somewhat strong physical symptoms."
SPEAKER_00,201.28,206.456," You have your heart racing a bit you said, sweaty palms, you're zoned out."
SPEAKER_00,207.56,213.639," Have you ever felt the need, desire to like run out of the room?"
SPEAKER_01,214.061,215.618," Yes, it's funny you should say that."
SPEAKER_01,216.4,223.875," I was a little bit hesitant to mention that but I kind of, I do, I feel like I need to  find an excuse to like use the bathroom or I just need to get out of there."
SPEAKER_00,225.743,231.419," Yeah, so what do you feel is most pressuring you to leave the room?"
SPEAKER_00,231.82,232.865, Like what symptom?
SPEAKER_01,236.24,243.329, I would say that just like my anxiety and my heart rate are starting to increase and  I feel like I just need to get out of there.
SPEAKER_00,245.52,247.219, What thoughts going through your mind right then?
SPEAKER_00,247.36,253.339," Like so let's take that kind of most severe moment when you're, let's just say we're still  before the presentation."
SPEAKER_01,253.42,253.502, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,254.42,263.315," So you're sitting at the desk and your heart rate's elevated and you're not focusing on  what they're doing, you're zoned out, your anxiety is high."
SPEAKER_01,264.0,264.122, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,265.121,266.833, What thought is going through your mind right then?
SPEAKER_01,267.78,275.936, I think I'm thinking like I'm going to bond this anyway so I might as well just you know  not go through the stress of having to do it.
SPEAKER_01,276.52,279.516, Like I've already in my head I know that it's going to end badly.
SPEAKER_00,280.28,282.218," So I've already, I've already failed?"
SPEAKER_01,282.6,292.552," Right, so there's no sense in getting up there and maybe if I don't get up there you know,  I guess it couldn't be any worse so I might as well just leave."
SPEAKER_00,294.7,305.387, Are you embarrassed that the professor or other students will see that you were really  anxious?
SPEAKER_01,306.441,322.445," Yeah, I don't want, I figure if I leave then people will just maybe think I was sick or  whatever and it'll be a better situation if I just left than having to see me up there  you know sweating and all this, these other symptoms that I have when I actually get up  there."
SPEAKER_01,323.22,325.3, It would be better just to leave before that starts.
SPEAKER_00,325.36,331.299," Okay, so better to be thought ill that you just had to leave because you're sick."
SPEAKER_01,331.46,338.38," Yeah, or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody you know."
SPEAKER_00,338.561,341.079, Have a severe anxiety in front of everybody and then they can see.
SPEAKER_01,341.18,341.956, Very embarrassing.
SPEAKER_00,342.561,347.217," Yeah, that would be, that would be a very undesirable outcome for you."
SPEAKER_00,348.286,348.49, Right.
SPEAKER_00,349.0,354.973," So as you're debating that thought, like if that's coming to your head and you're thinking  I just need to flee."
SPEAKER_01,355.583,356.755," Yeah, I just got to get out here."
SPEAKER_00,357.26,357.995, What happens there?
SPEAKER_00,358.26,361.796," So we're maybe, what maybe 15 minutes before you present?"
SPEAKER_00,362.58,363.294, So tell me about that.
SPEAKER_00,363.58,364.773," So you have that thought, you want to flee."
SPEAKER_01,365.48,379.214," Right and I'm looking at the clock and saying you know like how much more time in this presentation  before I have to go, like should I go, should I not go, what are the consequences of running  out you know and kind of playing out which would be worse."
SPEAKER_00,380.7,381.787, Have you ever had to run out?
SPEAKER_01,384.582,391.369, Once I went to the bathroom to try to like calm myself down or talk to myself or you  know like cool off my face.
SPEAKER_01,393.82,394.528, But I came back.
SPEAKER_00,395.7,396.312, And you presented.
SPEAKER_01,396.7,397.814, Yeah and then I presented.
SPEAKER_00,398.26,402.82," Alright so you, you survived one of the more stressful."
SPEAKER_01,403.441,405.719," Yeah, I almost felt like I was going to be ill."
SPEAKER_01,405.961,407.153, I was so stressed that day.
SPEAKER_00,408.243,409.697," That was very, very tough on you."
SPEAKER_00,409.98,410.102, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,411.647,412.8, That particular day.
SPEAKER_00,412.8,413.596, You did survive it.
SPEAKER_01,414.229,414.433, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,414.82,415.977," Yeah, it was just very unpleasant."
SPEAKER_01,416.22,416.812, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,417.975,418.2, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,418.421,423.578," So now we're, now we're right about to where it's time to get up and present."
SPEAKER_00,424.14,429.239," Right, so let's say in this scenario, if you haven't fled but you had those thoughts."
SPEAKER_00,429.501,429.705, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,430.46,434.395, So you're anxious and you have some physical symptoms going on.
SPEAKER_00,435.82,437.999, You get up and it's time to present.
SPEAKER_00,438.14,439.714, What's the sequence from this point on?
SPEAKER_01,440.34,444.897, So typically like I go to load my presentation.
SPEAKER_01,445.64,449.935, At this point like I have my new cards or whatever in front of me.
SPEAKER_01,451.561,454.439, I am like shaking at this point.
SPEAKER_01,454.66,465.054," I am so, I don't know if it's scared or worried or maybe a combination of everything and I'm  just like sweating."
SPEAKER_01,465.7,467.013, My heart is racing.
SPEAKER_01,467.78,469.398, Like I almost feel dizzy.
SPEAKER_01,469.72,479.838, I'm just so stressed out about what's going to happen and then you know I'm starting to  speak and then the presentations are usually like 20 minutes or so.
SPEAKER_00,480.38,480.564, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,481.44,492.356," So I have to stay up there for the duration and I'm just like you know sweating and then  I'm wondering like are people looking at me or people, can people see it?"
SPEAKER_01,493.32,494.908, You know am I going to forget something?
SPEAKER_00,497.501,501.639," So the, so the thoughts are I wonder if they can see how anxious I am."
SPEAKER_01,502.614,502.9, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,502.9,504.597, I wonder if I'm going to do poorly on the presentation.
SPEAKER_01,504.94,512.412, Right or they think I've been lazy and I didn't prepare or are they going to think that you  know I'm dumb or I don't know you know what I'm doing?
SPEAKER_01,514.42,515.493, What are they going to think about me?
SPEAKER_00,516.864,519.236," So they might, they might think less of you as a person."
SPEAKER_01,520.02,521.194, Right or like be judging me.
SPEAKER_00,521.66,522.048, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,523.395,523.64, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,523.66,529.978, So there's a number of concerns that kind of go into your mind in that moment.
SPEAKER_00,530.7,532.18, So when does it start to turn around?
SPEAKER_00,532.281,533.694," So you start presenting, it's 20 minutes."
SPEAKER_00,534.42,542.816," You initially get up there and get your presentation up on the, like the projection monitor, something  like that."
SPEAKER_01,543.449,543.551, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,544.02,545.434, When does it start to turn the corner?
SPEAKER_01,546.06,546.529, It depends.
SPEAKER_01,547.06,560.159," Sometimes I settle down a little bit but then usually like that, I get some sort of rhythm  I think and then, but then I get anxiety again until I get my grades."
SPEAKER_01,561.172,561.679, Do you know what I mean?
SPEAKER_01,561.84,566.678," And I'm like until, cause I feel like I'm going to do poorly until that happens."
SPEAKER_00,567.26,568.268, When do you receive the grades?
SPEAKER_01,569.86,574.868," Sometimes like she usually doesn't give them that day, but like often like the next day  or the day after."
SPEAKER_00,576.06,580.444, So does that intense anxiety that you're having while you're presenting last all the way to  now?
SPEAKER_01,581.32,584.176," No, it's definitely like dissipates once I can like go sit down."
SPEAKER_00,585.063,585.471, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,586.402,591.28," So, so the, so the next big drop off for symptoms would be when you're done the presentation."
SPEAKER_01,591.36,591.483, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,592.34,595.356," When eyes are maybe no longer on me, they've moved on to somebody else."
SPEAKER_01,596.1,597.78," So I figure like, okay, they forgot about me."
SPEAKER_01,597.84,599.353, I'm safe for right then.
SPEAKER_00,600.18,603.839, But then there's this other worry of now we have to see what the grades are going to be.
SPEAKER_01,603.98,606.21, And I convince myself that I did poorly.
SPEAKER_00,608.661,613.097, So the thought that's going through your mind is I'm going to receive a bad grade.
SPEAKER_01,613.78,613.943, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,614.8,621.377," And that everyone saw me, you know, sweating and all these symptoms that I have, everyone  is judging me."
