SPEAKER_00,27.285,33.479," Alright, so let's, if we could, let's rank those two things."
SPEAKER_00,34.122,36.398," Right, so one is everyone is judging me."
SPEAKER_00,36.801,37.426, They saw how I was.
SPEAKER_01,39.403,39.607, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,40.24,41.091, And the other is a poor grade.
SPEAKER_00,41.8,44.669, Which one is a larger fear for you?
SPEAKER_01,48.041,49.778, I would say maybe like judging.
SPEAKER_00,50.606,52.039," Okay, so the grade's a concern."
SPEAKER_01,52.563,55.359," Yeah, but I figure I could do better on the subsequent one."
SPEAKER_01,55.52,59.296," But when people have this opinion of you, I feel like that doesn't go away as quickly."
SPEAKER_00,61.303,69.906," Alright, um, and what would it mean if they, they thought you were anxious during that  presentation?"
SPEAKER_01,71.98,78.617, I guess I worry that they would think I'm anxious because I don't know what I'm doing  or I don't belong there.
SPEAKER_00,78.941,80.038," Okay, I don't belong there."
SPEAKER_01,80.2,80.282, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,81.28,89.039," So if they notice you were anxiety, then they think you don't belong at that level."
SPEAKER_01,89.663,91.858," Yeah, like I don't deserve to be in that program."
SPEAKER_00,92.16,93.936, I don't deserve to be in that program.
SPEAKER_01,94.32,94.402, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,95.504,95.606, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,96.32,100.78," If they don't recognize those symptoms, they wouldn't think that, but if they do, that's"
SPEAKER_00,100.882,101.739, what they might think.
SPEAKER_01,101.8,105.116," Right, like maybe they think that's why I'm anxious or that's why I'm not doing well."
SPEAKER_00,107.1,113.377," Well, how do you feel about your abilities and status in the program you're in?"
SPEAKER_01,114.78,122.234," I think, you know, typically I'm one of the top students in my program and I seem to get  the concepts pretty well."
SPEAKER_01,122.96,133.818," It's just when I have to demonstrate those concepts or demonstrate via like a presentation  or something that I'm worried that, you know, maybe I'm an imposter or something."
SPEAKER_01,135.345,137.336," But, so I start to question myself."
SPEAKER_01,139.263,148.074," But I think in general that, you know, I'm a pretty good student before this and I'm  doing pretty well in the program."
SPEAKER_00,149.264,150.916," Alright, so you're a good student."
SPEAKER_00,151.44,152.358, You recognize that.
SPEAKER_00,153.223,156.939, You have this one area where you don't feel like you do a great job.
SPEAKER_00,157.12,158.12, That's presentations.
SPEAKER_01,158.12,158.528, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,159.603,162.96," But in terms of grade, you really only had one bad presentation."
SPEAKER_01,163.042,163.225, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,164.68,170.419," But grades aside, you're anxious and you're worried your classmates are going to pick"
SPEAKER_00,170.741,171.578, up on that.
SPEAKER_01,171.72,172.367," Yeah, exactly."
SPEAKER_00,173.68,177.979," Okay, so if they thought you were, you used the word imposter."
SPEAKER_01,178.382,178.647, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,179.28,185.118," So if they thought you were an imposter, let's just say that that was something they actually  believed because of what's been happening."
SPEAKER_01,185.4,185.543, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,186.461,187.114, What would that mean?
SPEAKER_00,187.541,191.054, What would it mean to you if your classmates thought you were an imposter?
SPEAKER_01,193.002,196.239," Um, I don't know."
SPEAKER_01,196.48,196.928, Maybe I am.
SPEAKER_01,197.6,198.886, Maybe I don't deserve to be there.
SPEAKER_00,202.021,203.857, I don't deserve to be there.
SPEAKER_01,204.301,206.96," Yeah, like maybe I shouldn't be in this program."
SPEAKER_01,206.96,208.91, Like maybe I should just drop out.
SPEAKER_00,212.685,219.755," Alright, so if they believe, if they believe you're an imposter based on these physical  symptoms and anxiety."
SPEAKER_00,221.24,227.472," Maybe that means to you anyway, maybe that means you shouldn't, you are an imposter,  you shouldn't be there."
SPEAKER_01,227.921,228.227, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,230.006,231.553," What's it, what's it feel like to say that?"
SPEAKER_01,232.88,233.37, Depressing.
SPEAKER_00,234.043,234.207, Yeah?
SPEAKER_01,235.064,235.186, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,236.081,247.576," I feel like I've worked really hard, you know, to get through, you know, at least halfway  through my program and it really hurts to think that that would be true."
SPEAKER_00,251.0,254.399," To think this whole time you've really been, you've been faking it."
SPEAKER_00,254.64,255.529, You don't really belong there.
SPEAKER_01,256.64,256.722, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,260.981,270.019," So, I'd like to move a little bit into evaluating evidence if that's okay."
SPEAKER_01,270.742,271.007, Sure.
SPEAKER_00,271.762,271.946, Right?
SPEAKER_00,272.64,286.976," So in cognitive therapy we like to look at what's, you know, what we're feeling and what  we're thinking and what's, what we can see, what's observable around us and, you know,  that becomes evidence and then we analyze it, evaluate it."
SPEAKER_01,288.448,288.611, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,289.04,296.04," You're worried at some level, you're worried that you don't deserve to be where you are  right now."
SPEAKER_01,296.04,296.142, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,298.343,304.198, That you're not good enough to be a student in this program.
SPEAKER_01,305.122,305.326, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,309.506,316.037, What evidence supports that belief that you're not good enough?
SPEAKER_01,318.825,323.44," Now that I'm thinking about it here, I mean, there's not a ton to support it."
SPEAKER_00,324.113,324.358, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,324.44,330.44," But in, on that day I can think of all sorts of, you know, things to tell myself."
SPEAKER_00,330.44,333.057," Well, let's go there then on that day."
SPEAKER_01,333.84,354.153," So maybe like, I'm not, because I'm not prepared or because I'm messing up on, on the presentation  that I'm going to get a bad grade and, you know, if I can't, if I can't speak in front  of people, how am I going to speak in front of kids as a teacher, you know, one day that  it will translate to something else."
SPEAKER_01,355.345,356.82, Like if I can't get past this.
SPEAKER_00,357.483,361.84, So even if I survive the program somehow I might be bad at my job.
SPEAKER_01,362.167,362.473, Yeah.
