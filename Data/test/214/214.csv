SPEAKER_00,58.162,69.632," Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden that should help with the ear infection,  but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these  just in the past year or so."
SPEAKER_00,70.62,71.735, That's really a big problem.
SPEAKER_01,72.14,74.379," Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us."
SPEAKER_01,74.703,75.76, I think it's really upset.
SPEAKER_00,76.081,81.719," Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually  smoke exposure."

SPEAKER_01,84.202,87.738," Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him."
SPEAKER_01,88.221,90.158, I try really hard not to smoke around him.
SPEAKER_00,90.741,98.793," Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is  being exposed to smoke, and so what can you tell me about that?"

SPEAKER_00,115.74,119.619," I really need you to quit smoking, both for your health and for Aiden."
SPEAKER_00,119.92,140.057," Did you know smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it  could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here, but  also things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, asthma,  other upper respiratory infections."
SPEAKER_00,140.32,141.993, It's really putting him at a lot of risk.
SPEAKER_00,142.8,146.24," In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves."

SPEAKER_00,200.8,202.899, There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit.
SPEAKER_00,203.04,204.05, This is really important.
