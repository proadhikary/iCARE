SPEAKER_00,6.053,10.773," Alright, Carmelo, I want to take a couple of minutes and go over the skill and anger  that you filled out when you got here."
SPEAKER_00,11.58,19.274," You had mentioned that some people in your life have kind of commented and they said,  you know, maybe you ought to look into thinking about whether or not you have some issues  with anger or not."
SPEAKER_00,19.56,20.693, And that's one of the reasons you're here.
SPEAKER_00,21.32,26.679, And I'm hoping that this will help sort of identify specific issues related to anger  that might be problematic for you.
SPEAKER_00,26.821,28.415, And so this is really feedback meant for you.
SPEAKER_00,28.92,30.48, You can do whatever you like with the information.
SPEAKER_00,30.601,32.072, It's just for you to consider it.
SPEAKER_00,33.282,34.694, And so let's go through each area.
SPEAKER_00,35.541,39.518, And there are a number of questions here and a number of sort of different anger dimensions.
SPEAKER_00,40.08,49.072," And I think the place we're going to start is if you look at all the questions that you  answered, it comes up with something called a total score, which is just kind of looking  at everything together."
SPEAKER_00,49.74,53.08," And when we look at the total score, you scored quite high, actually."
SPEAKER_00,53.08,64.97," You scored in a range that we would sort of call the 99th percentile, which means, yeah,  which means that your anger is at a level greater than 99% of the population of men  your age."
SPEAKER_01,65.745,66.235, Are you kidding me?
SPEAKER_00,66.623,67.48," You know, that's kind of hard."
SPEAKER_00,67.725,68.011, That high.
SPEAKER_00,68.762,69.869, Kind of hard to hear it that way.
SPEAKER_00,76.396,77.179, It kind of surprised you?
SPEAKER_01,78.151,78.355, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,79.184,81.598," Well, I didn't think I was going to rate that high."
SPEAKER_01,82.543,87.126," I mean, I figured a lot of people was in my category, but I would have figured that I  was probably in about the 60%, 75."
SPEAKER_00,89.16,90.174, Just a little above average.
SPEAKER_01,90.762,90.926, Wow.
SPEAKER_01,91.64,92.456, That's way up there.
SPEAKER_00,92.741,98.859," It's a little bit high, and it might indicate that really anger does get you in trouble  at times in terms of relationships and causing them."
SPEAKER_00,99.021,99.899, So you've recognized that?
SPEAKER_01,100.287,100.919, I've always recognized it.
SPEAKER_01,101.001,101.919, I've seen it.
SPEAKER_01,102.342,107.652," I've tried to deny it a lot of times, but then I've recognized it that I know I have  issues."
SPEAKER_00,108.387,108.938, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,109.04,111.919, So this kind of just highlights that and puts a number on it in a sense.
SPEAKER_01,112.261,114.016, So that's where the studies have been done.
SPEAKER_00,114.46,115.032," Yeah, right."
SPEAKER_00,115.56,122.01," So you're kind of comparing how you answered the question to the general population of  the folks your age, but you're really in the top 1% of scores."
SPEAKER_00,127.414,128.419, I didn't think I was that bad.
SPEAKER_01,129.627,131.5, I've got a lot of serious problems.
SPEAKER_01,131.62,135.279," I mean, the same thing that they do to me, I do to them."
SPEAKER_01,135.64,140.772," So a lot of times I'm surprised, especially in the environment that I live in, that I  haven't gotten shot or stabbed or killed yet."
SPEAKER_01,141.62,144.459," I mean, it should definitely have happened, and I'm surprised it hasn't."
SPEAKER_00,144.68,148.772," Because getting angry, saying things to people, not thinking things through can really put  you at risk."
SPEAKER_01,149.547,150.16, Exactly.
SPEAKER_01,150.2,151.978, Same things I can do to them for anger me to that point.
SPEAKER_01,152.18,155.798, It's the same thing as me getting them back for what they've said before.
SPEAKER_01,156.261,158.059, So it could go in vice versa aspects.
SPEAKER_01,158.241,159.66," They could kill me, I could kill them."
