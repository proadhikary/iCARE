SPEAKER_00,9.135,13.563,"I mean, how does your body feel when you think about showing him that  vulnerable side of you?"
SPEAKER_00,14.445,15.769,Can you feel that in your body?

SPEAKER_01,25.44,25.721, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,25.841,32.16,"Sort of like, ugh, and wanting to lift that stone out, so to speak."
SPEAKER_01,32.322,33.056, The vulnerability?
SPEAKER_01,33.24,33.927, The vulnerability.
SPEAKER_01,35.12,36.087, You don't want to be vulnerable.
SPEAKER_01,36.108,37.68,It's so painful for you to be vulnerable.
SPEAKER_01,37.72,39.292, It's so painful to be vulnerable.
SPEAKER_00,41.412,42.019, Right.
SPEAKER_01,42.962,48.472," Whereas, I think you have seen me in vulnerable situations more because of medical problems."
SPEAKER_01,52.88,59.737," And when someone else is vulnerable, not me, I can be seen as capable."
SPEAKER_00,61.381,61.481, Ah.
SPEAKER_00,63.805,70.098,"So there's a sadness here when your partner says, I don't really see."
SPEAKER_00,70.118,72.927,You don't really  show me that softer part of you.
SPEAKER_00,72.947,76.968,"And there's a sadness there, and it feels like a stone  in your stomach, right?"
SPEAKER_00,78.72,80.225, But somehow you help me.
SPEAKER_00,80.346,86.265,"It's like, what I'm hearing is for you to actually touch that  vulnerability and show him."
SPEAKER_00,86.285,90.617,"There's something about not being capable there, not being strong."
SPEAKER_00,91.9,92.431, Is that it?
SPEAKER_01,92.88,94.986, Not really knowing how to do that.
SPEAKER_01,96.09,98.417,How do you show that vulnerability?
SPEAKER_01,98.858,101.04,How to actually  name it or to stay with that vulnerability?
SPEAKER_01,101.06,103.777, And feel comfortable.
SPEAKER_01,104.28,105.707, And feel comfortable about doing that.
SPEAKER_01,108.64,119.671," And to me, you could say it's associated to trust or intellectually, but it's very,  very difficult to actually..."
SPEAKER_00,121.84,123.377," It's difficult for all of us, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,123.6,124.273, To give that up.
SPEAKER_00,124.6,126.333," It's difficult for all of us, right?"
SPEAKER_01,128.098,128.2, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,128.2,129.564, Right.
SPEAKER_00,129.584,132.633,And we all have that sense of needing to protect ourselves.
SPEAKER_00,133.957,141.044,"And I think what you  guys are telling me... I mean, we could go back and talk about your relationships, your  past relationships."
SPEAKER_00,141.085,144.138,We've often learned that it's a very bad idea to be vulnerable.
SPEAKER_00,144.519,151.15,But  we're talking about that you guys are also in a cultural context where that's not encouraged  to be vulnerable like that.
SPEAKER_01,152.36,155.619," And to some degree, we have been vulnerable because of cultural context."
SPEAKER_00,155.921,157.267," Yes, you have."
SPEAKER_00,157.287,160.388,"Well, you've been together for a long time, and so you're... Is that  what you mean?"
SPEAKER_01,161.02,161.612," No, I mean being gay."
SPEAKER_00,162.02,162.959, That's what I mean.
SPEAKER_01,163.102,163.837, Being vulnerable.
SPEAKER_00,164.327,164.469, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,165.0,166.0,You're even more vulnerable gay.
SPEAKER_00,166.041,166.143, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,167.0,168.899," There's a vulnerability about being gay, period."
SPEAKER_01,169.102,169.429, Exactly.
SPEAKER_00,170.302,173.338," So there's an even... You need to protect, yeah?"
SPEAKER_00,173.841,180.791, I validate and normalize their need to protect themselves as individuals and gay men in a  heterosexual world.
