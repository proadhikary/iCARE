SPEAKER_01,8.913,12.198, I don't want to talk to you anymore.
SPEAKER_01,13.36,14.045, You're all the same.
SPEAKER_01,15.9,16.203, All of you.
SPEAKER_01,17.961,18.972, I have been wasting my time.
SPEAKER_01,20.266,21.276, I have been wasting my time.
SPEAKER_01,22.326,23.033, You're all the same.
SPEAKER_01,23.8,25.579, All of you guys are exactly the same.
SPEAKER_01,25.64,27.514, You ask me to come in and just...
SPEAKER_01,28.36,33.655, I don't want to talk to you anymore because I come in here and I talk and I talk and I  talk and I talk and I don't get anything out of it.
SPEAKER_01,34.36,35.054, You're all the same.
SPEAKER_00,36.229,37.22," When you say we're all, you mean..."
SPEAKER_01,37.24,38.077, You're all of you.
SPEAKER_01,38.342,39.138, All of you.
SPEAKER_00,39.464,40.118, All therapists?
SPEAKER_01,40.24,40.771, All therapists.
SPEAKER_01,41.24,42.28, All of you guys are exactly the same.
SPEAKER_01,42.28,43.28, You're all the same.
SPEAKER_01,43.441,49.64," No matter which one I've been to, I always go thinking, I'm going to get helped, I'm  going to get helped, and then I get nothing out of it."
SPEAKER_01,49.721,51.297, I'm wasting my time.
SPEAKER_01,51.64,53.658, There is no point in me coming back here anymore.
SPEAKER_01,53.84,57.479, There really is no point because you're all exactly the same.
SPEAKER_01,57.76,60.599, You all sit there just like you're sitting here right now.
SPEAKER_01,60.72,64.776, You all sit there just like that and you just stare at me.
SPEAKER_01,65.84,68.815, You just stare at me and you don't do anything for me.
SPEAKER_01,69.8,70.494, You don't help me.
SPEAKER_01,70.8,71.412, There is no help.
SPEAKER_01,71.82,78.2," There's just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, and I never get anything out  of it."
SPEAKER_01,78.22,79.96, So what's the point?
SPEAKER_01,79.96,82.0, There's no point in me coming here anymore.
SPEAKER_01,82.0,82.873, There really is no point.
SPEAKER_00,83.942,88.038," Okay, I mean, I'm having a couple of reactions to what you're saying."
SPEAKER_00,88.44,92.578, One is that you're saying you're all the same.
SPEAKER_01,92.96,93.768, You are all the same.
SPEAKER_01,94.96,95.736, You are all the same.
SPEAKER_01,96.686,97.695, I've been to four of you guys.
SPEAKER_01,98.2,99.069, Nothing is working.
SPEAKER_01,100.12,100.826, Nothing is working.
SPEAKER_01,102.44,103.065, You're all the same.
SPEAKER_00,105.2,108.178, I'm feeling just lumped in with everybody else right now.
SPEAKER_01,108.804,110.117," Well, you are because you're all the same."
SPEAKER_01,110.885,112.12," Of course, you're lumped in with everybody."
SPEAKER_01,112.12,113.678, I'm not going to single you out.
SPEAKER_01,114.722,119.737, I'm not going to make you single you out because you're all not doing anything.
SPEAKER_01,120.96,122.076, You don't do anything.
SPEAKER_01,122.36,127.884," There's all this abstract metaphysical stuff and there's no concrete, this is the way to  fix it."
SPEAKER_01,129.28,129.803, This is the goal.
SPEAKER_01,133.144,133.838, There's nothing.
SPEAKER_01,133.94,134.389, So what's the point?
SPEAKER_00,134.94,135.042, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,136.964,142.99," I mean, is there something specific right now that I could say or do that would give  you what you're wanting or needing?"
SPEAKER_01,145.283,149.859, How do I go from point A to point B?
SPEAKER_01,150.16,151.017, How do I get better?
SPEAKER_01,151.2,153.8, How do I fix what's going on?
SPEAKER_01,153.84,155.338," I mean, that's the reason I came here, right?"
SPEAKER_01,156.145,157.393, I thought that was the reason I came here.
SPEAKER_01,158.722,159.991, It was to fix things.
SPEAKER_01,161.32,161.962, Make things better.
SPEAKER_00,166.68,168.805, So you want a step-by-step description of how?
SPEAKER_01,175.34,176.776," Well, something."
SPEAKER_01,177.14,178.359, I need something to grab onto.
SPEAKER_00,178.481,179.52, You need something to hold onto?
SPEAKER_01,179.52,180.911, I need something to grab onto.
SPEAKER_01,182.915,183.099, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,183.629,183.874, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,184.621,195.807," See, my sense is that you sort of desperately want something to grab onto to give you some  sense of hope."
SPEAKER_00,197.52,222.656," I really want to be able to give you something, but it feels like there's something about  the kind of intensity of your sort of demand or plea right now, which makes it difficult  for me to really sort of respond in a way that's going to give you what you need."
SPEAKER_00,224.602,235.278, Or a better way of putting it is I have a sense that the kind of thing that you want  or you're needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between the two of us.
SPEAKER_00,235.88,250.199," And there's something about the sort of intensity of your desperation, which makes it difficult  for you to really be open and receptive to whatever I have to give."
SPEAKER_01,252.609,253.373, That's just the way I am.
SPEAKER_01,255.607,256.699, I always come out like that.
SPEAKER_01,256.76,261.099, I always ... It's the way I get things.
SPEAKER_01,261.745,262.82, It's the only way I get things.
SPEAKER_01,262.84,263.725, It's the only way I know how to be.
SPEAKER_01,266.4,267.456, I come out one of two ways.
SPEAKER_01,267.74,274.199," I come out either full throttle, just full tilt."
SPEAKER_01,274.54,276.878, Just come at them and just do it that way.
SPEAKER_01,277.1,278.268, Or I don't do anything at all.
SPEAKER_01,279.9,283.699, So it's like I'm one way and it's not good enough.
SPEAKER_01,283.98,285.626, And I'm the other way and it's not good enough.
SPEAKER_00,289.34,292.579, So it's like damned if you do and damned if you don't.
SPEAKER_01,292.881,293.977," Damned if I do, damned if I don't."
SPEAKER_01,294.24,300.379," If I go one way at everybody, it doesn't seem to make a difference one way or the other."
SPEAKER_01,300.8,306.935," And then if I'm just quiet and just falling with the crowd, it doesn't matter either."
SPEAKER_00,308.76,312.715, It sounds like it feels like you only have two choices.
SPEAKER_00,314.24,323.08, You can either approach the situation kind of on the attack with both guns blazing.
SPEAKER_01,323.301,325.233, That's a good way to describe it.
SPEAKER_01,326.28,326.886, Both guns blazing.
SPEAKER_00,328.601,334.09, Or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way.
SPEAKER_00,340.08,343.952," Of those two, which feels better or which feels worse?"
SPEAKER_01,346.28,349.077, The both guns blazing always feels better.
SPEAKER_01,349.48,359.857," Because if I go at somebody with full force and hit them over the head and just go at  them, even if they turn away, it doesn't really matter."
SPEAKER_01,360.48,362.936, Because I've already said my piece and said what I had to say.
SPEAKER_01,363.48,373.879," But if I don't say anything and I just sit back and don't do anything, then it just gets  me as angry as the both guns blazing."
SPEAKER_01,374.04,376.599, So it just eats me up.
SPEAKER_01,376.76,380.867, But it eats me up in here and I get even angrier than if I just blurt it all out and get it  all out.
SPEAKER_00,381.642,381.867, Right.
SPEAKER_00,383.082,384.809," Yeah, I can imagine that."
SPEAKER_00,390.868,398.665," At least if you're going in there with both guns blazing, there's a way in which you can  kind of feel okay about yourself in some way, even though you're not getting your needs  met."
SPEAKER_00,399.642,401.657, But somehow they're sort of giving in.
SPEAKER_00,402.08,405.228, It's like you're giving away part of yourself in some way.
SPEAKER_00,409.96,417.471, It seems to me that the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met  right now.
SPEAKER_00,417.92,420.8, You sort of desperately need something.
SPEAKER_01,421.486,422.818, There's no middle ground.
SPEAKER_00,423.02,423.926, There's no middle ground.
SPEAKER_00,425.88,442.837," So I'm not sure exactly what that middle ground is right now, but I'm willing to work with  you to really work on discovering what that middle ground is."
SPEAKER_00,444.28,445.287, Does that seem worthwhile?
SPEAKER_01,447.362,447.892, I have to.
SPEAKER_01,449.184,452.095, I have to find a middle ground.
SPEAKER_00,454.002,455.808, What are you feeling right now?
SPEAKER_01,459.541,462.798, Just it bothers me.
SPEAKER_01,463.2,465.085, I can't go one way or the other.
SPEAKER_01,471.48,472.48, I try to do one thing and I can't do it.
SPEAKER_01,472.541,473.419, I try to do it the other way.
SPEAKER_01,473.48,473.786, I can't do it.
SPEAKER_01,474.97,475.46, I'm just stuck.
SPEAKER_00,475.48,476.48, There's a real kind of sadness there and maybe a hopelessness.
SPEAKER_01,476.48,476.99, I don't know what to do.
SPEAKER_01,477.48,478.48, It feels like there's nothing I can do.
SPEAKER_01,478.48,479.439, There's just no good way of doing it.
SPEAKER_01,480.346,485.662,It almost feels like what's the point? 
SPEAKER_00,485.662,512.32,"Yeah. You look at me, in the sense of what's going on for youÂ…"
SPEAKER_00,512.32,516.615, It's almost as if you're asking for something.
SPEAKER_01,518.041,518.755, I need something.
SPEAKER_01,520.404,521.207, I can't get it myself.
SPEAKER_00,525.701,526.171,"You know, I hear that. I hear that."
SPEAKER_00,526.76,533.373, I hear your desperation and I hear your sadness and your pain and your hopelessness.
SPEAKER_00,537.382,539.52, I'll do my best to help you.
