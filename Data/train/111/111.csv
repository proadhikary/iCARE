SPEAKER_00,5.814,7.538," So, Eric, what's on the agenda for today?"
SPEAKER_01,8.825,9.713, Definitely my dad.
SPEAKER_01,10.44,14.699, He's just been on my case like all week getting on me.
SPEAKER_01,15.341,20.439, He's being a real jerk in my room playing video games and talking to my friends.
SPEAKER_01,20.6,22.411, And he just barges into my room.
SPEAKER_01,23.86,25.009, He's getting on me at dinner.
SPEAKER_01,26.42,27.658, He just never lets up.
SPEAKER_01,27.84,30.834," He's on me about getting a job, getting my life together."
SPEAKER_01,32.26,33.056, All the time.
SPEAKER_01,33.381,40.154," As soon as I wake up in the morning, there's an email from him or something just telling  me to do stuff I don't want to do."
SPEAKER_01,40.84,44.758, It doesn't get that I'm not feeling good and I'm not going to do that stuff.
SPEAKER_00,45.14,46.874, Let me interrupt you for just a second here.
SPEAKER_00,47.68,48.796, Make sure I understand you.
SPEAKER_00,49.04,53.738," You're really upset about your father getting on you this past week, right?"
SPEAKER_01,54.567,54.771, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,55.24,56.812, There's something that we could talk about today.
SPEAKER_00,58.04,61.499, Is there something that you think we could do to help the situation out?
SPEAKER_01,61.922,64.395," Yeah, we've got to figure out some way to get him to back off."
SPEAKER_01,65.44,66.754, He's just on me.
SPEAKER_01,67.32,70.338, Maybe we can bring him in here or tell him something.
SPEAKER_01,71.391,71.959, Write him a letter.
SPEAKER_01,72.0,72.388, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,73.0,75.318, But something to just get him to leave me alone.
SPEAKER_00,75.56,79.799, Well one idea would be to get him to bring him in here and get him to back off.
SPEAKER_00,79.92,80.971, But he's not here right now.
SPEAKER_00,81.88,86.84, Maybe there's some things that you can do to help him calm down or back off the situation.
SPEAKER_01,86.921,87.931, He's the one being a jerk.
SPEAKER_00,88.86,97.558," Well that may be, but maybe there's some things you could do to be a little more assertive  with him, to let him know how you're feeling, or perhaps to calm the situation down."
SPEAKER_01,98.363,98.751, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,99.2,101.315, I mean if you've got some ideas I'll listen I guess.
SPEAKER_00,102.161,107.338, Okay well maybe we can put our heads together and come up with some strategies to deal with  your dad a little bit better.
SPEAKER_01,107.481,107.869, All right.
SPEAKER_00,108.44,109.172," Is that Sutter, right?"
SPEAKER_01,109.64,109.722, Sure.
SPEAKER_00,110.64,112.058, Is there anything we could put down on the agenda then?
SPEAKER_01,112.343,112.506, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,113.2,114.2, No I definitely want to talk about that.
SPEAKER_00,114.2,115.93, So how do I describe that then?
SPEAKER_01,117.62,118.335, Dealing with my dad.
SPEAKER_00,118.763,119.029, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,119.7,125.6, Dealing with dad.
SPEAKER_00,125.6,127.448, Is there anything else you'd like to put on the agenda?

SPEAKER_00,161.342,162.517, Do it definitely with your dad.
SPEAKER_00,162.72,162.842, Okay.
