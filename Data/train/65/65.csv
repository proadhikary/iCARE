SPEAKER_01,28.641,29.478," Yeah, it is."
SPEAKER_00,30.2,33.297, Is there anything else besides your headache that you want to address here today at the  clinical department?
SPEAKER_01,33.621,36.439," No, it's just that, except I am concerned."
SPEAKER_01,36.6,40.724, I just recently changed insurance companies and I'm not sure this is going to be covered  yet.
SPEAKER_00,42.296,42.52, All right.
SPEAKER_00,42.52,51.569," Was there anything, because what we can do is while we're talking and I'm doing your  history and physical, I'll have my office secretary look into the insurance plan that  you have."
SPEAKER_01,52.12,52.385, All right.
SPEAKER_00,53.12,54.079, So you don't have to worry about that.
SPEAKER_01,54.14,54.63," Yeah, that sounds good."
SPEAKER_00,55.487,55.998," Okay, sounds great."
SPEAKER_00,56.202,57.1, Is there anything else?

SPEAKER_00,61.071,61.214, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,61.52,66.137," So what I'd like to do today, and let's take a look at what's causing your headache."
SPEAKER_00,67.04,76.58," I will go over history, physical, and then we'll do again a physical exam, and then we  will look into your insurance policy and make sure that's all, you know, taken care of."
SPEAKER_00,76.6,77.876, Does that sound like a good plan for you?
SPEAKER_01,78.18,78.425, That's good.
SPEAKER_00,79.16,80.14, Perfect.
SPEAKER_00,81.304,84.577," So tell me a little bit more about this, the head pain that you're having."
SPEAKER_01,85.641,92.258," Well, it started about three days ago, and nothing has helped it."
SPEAKER_01,93.16,94.178, It's just laid me flat.
SPEAKER_01,94.481,96.387, I haven't been able to go to work.
SPEAKER_01,100.72,101.143, Nothing's helped.
SPEAKER_01,103.36,103.984, It's all over.
SPEAKER_01,106.48,112.253," It's really bad when I move, so I'm trying not to move too much, and the light is bothering  me a lot."
SPEAKER_00,113.192,113.58, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,113.58,120.659," Unfortunately, I can't dim the lights in this room, but I'll try to go quickly, and  it would be okay if I took some notes."
SPEAKER_01,120.881,121.31," Oh, sure."
SPEAKER_00,122.147,122.514, All right.
SPEAKER_00,122.82,124.513, So you said this headache started about three days ago.
SPEAKER_01,125.381,125.503, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,126.36,126.563, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,127.98,132.199," Was there anything that brought it on, anything unusual that happened maybe three days ago?"
SPEAKER_01,132.58,133.004," Not really, no."
SPEAKER_00,135.204,135.388, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,135.98,138.293, Can you tell me anything that makes it better?

SPEAKER_01,145.6,147.115, I just try not to move too much.
SPEAKER_00,147.58,147.782, All right.
SPEAKER_00,149.22,150.373, Is there anything that makes it worse?
SPEAKER_01,151.02,153.476," Yeah, movement and light."
SPEAKER_00,154.161,154.998, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,155.321,157.191," And it's just constant, though."
SPEAKER_01,158.9,159.673, It's just constant.
SPEAKER_01,160.06,160.525, It's all over.
SPEAKER_00,162.769,162.971, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,163.7,169.131," So if you had to rate it on a pain scale, zero being no pain, 10 being the worst pain  you ever had."
SPEAKER_01,169.621,170.131, It's a 10.
SPEAKER_00,170.58,170.641, A 10?
SPEAKER_01,171.58,172.396," Yeah, it's a headache like this."
SPEAKER_00,172.682,172.886, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,173.58,174.315," Yeah, that sounds really bad."

SPEAKER_00,177.86,180.3, You said the pain is all up here in the front of your head?
SPEAKER_01,180.34,181.495, It's kind of all over.
SPEAKER_00,181.921,182.166, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,183.0,188.758," But also, I've got this shooting pain down my neck, and my neck is very stiff."
SPEAKER_00,189.5,189.582, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,190.962,193.495," But it's not, it's the entire head."

SPEAKER_00,199.38,204.959," As far as in the timing, you said that it started three days ago, but you said it's  a constant."
SPEAKER_01,205.081,205.326, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,206.102,207.02, It comes and goes.
SPEAKER_01,207.542,213.42," It started gradually, but once it got there, it hasn't gone away."
SPEAKER_01,213.5,215.979, It doesn't get better.
SPEAKER_01,216.08,216.836, It doesn't get worse.
SPEAKER_01,217.06,217.626, It's just the same.
SPEAKER_00,219.525,219.706, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,221.1,225.619, So what I want to get is your perception of what you think is going on.
SPEAKER_01,225.74,226.658," Oh, I don't know."
SPEAKER_01,226.861,228.578," I just, I can hardly think."
SPEAKER_01,228.78,229.568, It's so painful.
SPEAKER_01,230.861,234.337," I just, because it's so bad, I was afraid."
SPEAKER_01,235.461,250.339," My neighbor had a headache and ignored it last year, and he suddenly started having  seizures and it turns out he had a brain tumor, so I thought I just should come in and look"
SPEAKER_01,250.886,251.131, at it.
SPEAKER_00,251.58,255.319," Yeah, I can understand your concern."
SPEAKER_00,255.42,256.938, How is it impacting your daily life?
