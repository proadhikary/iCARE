NARRATOR,1.264,11.992, Watch what happens this time when the youth minister allows the team to tell his story  and guides him to consider how his drinking could interfere with his goals and to think  about how he might benefit from making a change.
SPEAKER_00,13.62,27.084, So Tommy I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some  pictures from a party you were at and made me a little bit concerned because I saw you  were drinking and I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits in  your life.
SPEAKER_01,29.241,42.078, I mainly just drink whenever I'm at parties or whenever somebody hands me a beer I'll  take sips every now and then but it's not something that I feel hovers around my life.
SPEAKER_00,42.64,46.776, It's kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority.
SPEAKER_00,47.92,49.208, How much do you think you're drinking?
SPEAKER_01,51.52,72.717, I guess I would say like every other weekend maybe every two weeks on occasion maybe if  there's a basketball game going on or a football game I'll have a beer just to drink with my  boys but other than that I don't really see it as much of a problem.
SPEAKER_00,73.58,78.359, So you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend?
SPEAKER_01,78.821,79.931, Yeah I guess you can say that.
SPEAKER_00,81.02,85.282, How would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you  don't?
SPEAKER_01,88.46,115.751, When I'm not drinking I'm usually more involved in doing more productive things like I try  and do more school work whenever I have the time or whenever I can go work out or something  just to like whenever I'm drinking I devote my time to just letting loose and having fun  and just relaxing with friends.
SPEAKER_00,117.14,123.575, So you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends when you don't drink but maybe you  don't feel like you can relax as well.
SPEAKER_01,124.32,147.857, Yeah I mean whenever I'm drinking I know that I'm devoting time to not doing other things  so I try and make it so that I don't allow myself to pile on so much work so I try and  like get work done before but I know that drinking gets in the way of productivity so  I try and minimize that as much as possible.
SPEAKER_00,148.3,153.575, You're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done knowing that the drinking is going  to make it harder.
SPEAKER_01,154.31,154.698, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,154.82,160.228, Okay and but it sounds like are you getting everything done or is some stuff sort of slipping  when you drink?
SPEAKER_01,161.34,184.014, Yeah I guess when I drink some things do slip a little bit but just because like when I'm  drinking I'm not really focused on what I have to do I'm focused on the moment and just  enjoying the time that I have at that time and it's really something that I just it's  something of a pleasure giver it's like an enjoyment type of thing.
SPEAKER_00,185.52,187.352, What are the things you enjoy about the drinking?
SPEAKER_01,188.68,208.279, Just the way that it it sort of like liberates you it makes you it makes you feel like a  more confident more energetic person that you don't feel like yourself you feel like  a different version of yourself and it's something that you it it's just empowering to a degree.
SPEAKER_00,209.682,215.739, Okay so you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways?
SPEAKER_01,216.02,216.632, Yeah yeah.
SPEAKER_00,217.44,219.671, Are there any not so good things about drinking?
SPEAKER_01,221.56,243.879, Whenever I drink too much I sort of lose control of myself and I I just like the aftermath  of whenever I drink too much or whenever I my friends mix drinks and it just has a harmful  effect on my body and that's probably one of the major drawbacks that I have from drinking.
SPEAKER_00,244.32,245.27, What kinds of things happen?
SPEAKER_01,246.441,255.659, I mainly when when I puke or it's just the the feeling that I get in my stomach if I  drink too much is just very overwhelming.
SPEAKER_00,256.786,258.779, So like you notice it in your body?
SPEAKER_01,258.86,259.551, Oh yeah definitely.
SPEAKER_00,260.14,263.172, How much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time?
SPEAKER_01,265.26,297.713, Wow I would say probably at a friend one of my friends had a birthday party recently and  he wanted to let loose it was it was just a all the guys were together and they had  a couple of friends over and it just turned into one big party and I just I lost it I  drank way too much I would say like probably a bottle or two and just some beers along  the way like it got to a point where I lost count.
SPEAKER_00,299.08,301.354, That was out of the ordinary for you to lose count.
SPEAKER_00,302.44,305.073, What's a more typical amount that you drink?
SPEAKER_01,306.42,337.799, I don't let myself drink more than three or four beers on a given night just because I  know I've gotten to the point where I sort of know my limit but I kind of flirt with  my limit just to see how far I can go and I think that that sort of is very dangerous  to play with fire but I want to see how far I can go just so I know not to go that far.
SPEAKER_00,338.305,338.529, Got it.
SPEAKER_00,339.16,348.18, So you're sort of testing and pushing it and sometimes crossing that limit and having some  of the consequences that you mentioned before.
SPEAKER_01,348.18,359.739, Yeah just so I know how it feels now so that later on when this situation is more drastic  and more out of control I know what I can do or where my limit is at.
SPEAKER_00,360.04,366.93, Okay well kind of along those lines looking ahead you know five years from now what do  you see as a goal for yourself?
SPEAKER_01,368.56,370.499, In terms of career wise?
SPEAKER_00,370.56,372.791, Yeah in terms of what do you think you'll be doing in five years?
SPEAKER_01,374.66,399.718, I would love to be I would love to travel I would love to see the world for what it  is and I've always seen pictures and videos of how the world is but I've never really  experienced that like I've always wanted to travel to Europe or China or someplace like  that so I can really experience the world that we live in.
SPEAKER_00,400.38,412.917, So getting a full experience is really important to you it sounds like throughout your life  you know you talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience and  now you're looking ahead to think of how you can enrich your life in other ways.
SPEAKER_00,413.6,420.266, How do you think drinking too much would fit into you know being able to experience life  to its fullest?
SPEAKER_01,422.48,447.495, I guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effects of living life to the  fullest but I wouldn't want to tamper with drinking too much like often just because  I know I've seen the consequences that drinking has on people and I know that I would never  want to get to a degree where I need to drink constantly every single day.
SPEAKER_01,448.8,450.773, I don't want to ever get to that point.
SPEAKER_00,453.585,473.498, So just to kind of summarize what you've told me so far you're drinking pretty regularly  but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum  that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences and you feel  better if you limit yourself to three or less.
SPEAKER_01,473.84,474.891, Yeah I feel more in control.
SPEAKER_00,475.82,489.237, And then kind of looking ahead you don't want to find yourself being someone who's drinking  all the time or someone who feels out of control with their drinking that you've seen that  maybe in other people's lives and it's not appealing to you at all.
SPEAKER_00,490.182,497.136, And you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve that drinking too  much could also interfere with.
SPEAKER_00,497.8,501.756, So where do you think you want to go from here with regard to your drinking?
SPEAKER_01,504.88,513.519, Maybe now that I know my limits to an extent I kind of don't want to push it so much.
SPEAKER_01,514.161,520.8, Now that I know what I can do and where I can go I would like to mitigate that as much as possible.
SPEAKER_01,521.02,529.8, I just want to have fun being me but I don't want me to be influenced by alcohol so much.
SPEAKER_01,530.441,538.8, Like I want to live the sober life to an extent but I know that alcohol is just going to tamper with that.
SPEAKER_00,539.322,549.648, So for right now it feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking  and make sure you're stopping at three for example or maybe even limiting the number of times  that you're drinking.
SPEAKER_01,550.8,558.419, Yeah and like not drinking in the mornings or just strictly for social purposes.
SPEAKER_01,560.445,564.8, Just to not have it around like I don't want to have it in my fridge if my parents have it.
SPEAKER_01,565.162,567.337, I don't want to have to deal with that.
SPEAKER_00,568.505,570.055, What do you see as some benefits to that?
SPEAKER_01,571.204,572.537, Benefits in terms of?
SPEAKER_00,572.8,573.891, To sticking to those limits.
SPEAKER_01,574.8,580.76," I guess I could definitely be, I could live a more fulfilled life to an extent."
SPEAKER_01,580.92,592.64," Like I could possibly be more productive, more efficient in my work and where I can possibly be in the next few years of my life."
SPEAKER_01,592.94,599.539, I think that by not drinking it will definitely have a better effect on my life.
SPEAKER_00,599.82,604.76, Yeah well I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea.
SPEAKER_00,605.623,609.579, I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest.
SPEAKER_01,609.8,610.106, My pleasure.
SPEAKER_00,611.001,618.156, You know if you don't mind I would like to talk to you probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months  and just kind of check in how things are going.
SPEAKER_01,618.922,619.8, Alright sounds good.
SPEAKER_00,620.331,620.8, Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_01,620.963,621.371, Sure.
NARRATOR,623.8,632.359, This time the youth ministry began by expressing concern but relied on open questions and reflective listening to build rapport and encourage Tommy to share his experiences.
NARRATOR,633.462,640.239, Tommy provided a great deal of useful information regarding his drinking very quickly which set the stage for a more productive conversation.
NARRATOR,641.822,650.66," By exploring both sides of the issue, Tommy was given the opportunity to open up without fear of condemnation and was also able to admit to some of the consequences of his drinking."
NARRATOR,652.021,655.74, This gave him the chance to consider the reasons he might benefit from making a change.
NARRATOR,657.041,662.439, The youth minister also encouraged Tommy to look ahead to consider how his drinking could affect his future plans.
NARRATOR,663.321,672.8," By exploring his values and relating them to his drinking, she developed a discrepancy between his future goals and his current behaviors, highlighting the need to make some adjustments to his drinking."
NARRATOR,674.742,682.8," Using a summary, the youth minister was able to transition smoothly to a discussion of options and Tommy identified a realistic goal for himself that matched his values."
NARRATOR,684.245,688.8," As a result, he is much more likely to follow through on his plans and actually make a change in his drinking."
