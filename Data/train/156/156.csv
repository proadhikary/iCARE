SPEAKER_00," Vanessa, hi.",39.251,40.112
SPEAKER_00,It's nice to see you again.,40.312,41.615
SPEAKER_01,It's good to see you.,41.635,42.817
SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, how are you?",43.077,43.979
SPEAKER_01,I'm doing  okay.,43.999,45.281
SPEAKER_01,"You know, things have been settling down a bit, I think.",46.063,50.193
SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, the last time we saw,  things were pretty chaotic and hectic when you were being released from the, discharged from the  hospital about a week ago.",51.816,61.344
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,61.744,62.185
SPEAKER_00,How's your injury?,62.486,63.789
SPEAKER_01,"It's pretty pain, you know, had a lot of pain in  it.",63.809,68.861
SPEAKER_01,I've been kind of trying not to take too much pain medication and just kind of trying to keep  busy and focus on things that are happening.,68.881,77.31
SPEAKER_01,I've been busy with my church duties and with my kids.,77.37,79.86
SPEAKER_00, You've been trying to stay busy?,80.661,81.964
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, yeah.",82.065,82.586
SPEAKER_01,It's been hard to think about myself when I have so  many other things that are way more important than me to deal with.,82.666,91.133
SPEAKER_00,How are your kids doing?,91.756,92.9
SPEAKER_01, They're doing okay.,93.823,94.606
SPEAKER_01,"You know, the little ones were pretty kind of stressed out when I first  got home and they were a little unsure of themselves and what was going to happen,  but the older kids have helped out quite a bit, so I think they're pulling together.",94.646,108.26
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,108.26,108.621
SPEAKER_00,"I imagine that there's some, you know, period of readjustment and healing and sadness  or as in, it sounds like also just trying to get things done.",109.903,123.413
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,123.433,123.513
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, my motto is just to  keep moving, you know, moving as fast as I can, trying to get, you know, keep the house clean and  be good, you know, with my duties with my church and trying to keep the kids focused on their  activities and not to be too focused on what's happening in me and Paul's life because, you know,  there's nothing they can do about that.",124.175,146.765
SPEAKER_00,"So you're taking care of a lot of people,  your community, your kids, all the while trying to take care of yourself.",148.711,156.834
SPEAKER_00,That's a lot.,156.894,157.656
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,158.679,158.86
SPEAKER_00,I  really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate and how much you have  going on.,158.88,166.202
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,166.222,167.284
SPEAKER_00,"Well, you know, last time that we met, you had talked about how important it is for  you to do what you can to keep your kids and yourself safe.",167.965,180.972
SPEAKER_00,And I was wondering if you'd be  interested in talking a little bit more about that today or perhaps if there's something else  that you would rather talk about.,181.433,190.927
SPEAKER_01,"No, I, you know, I made time today to talk about this.",190.987,194.558
SPEAKER_01,I think it's  really important to try to figure something out.,194.619,197.327
SPEAKER_01,Things got very out of hand there.,197.387,198.952
SPEAKER_01,"And so it's,  I'm looking forward to thinking about what things I can do.",200.737,206.111
SPEAKER_00,So you were scared.,207.335,208.658
SPEAKER_00,It sounds like you  were scared.,208.678,209.862
SPEAKER_01,It was terrifying.,209.922,210.846
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, we, police were called, you know, we ended up having to call  the police and Paul was arrested and spent some time in jail.",210.966,220.413
SPEAKER_01,I had child welfare folks crawling  all over my house and my mom was upset and neighbors were all being nosy and gossiping.,221.636,230.74
SPEAKER_01, And it was just very scary.,231.08,236.593
SPEAKER_00,So a lot of things were turned upside down.,237.014,238.818
SPEAKER_00,"And when you say it was  scary, I hear you saying on some level it was scary for you and your safety, but it also sounds  like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive.",238.858,252.98
SPEAKER_01, Right.,253.281,253.562
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, it was, you know, we had people come into the house calling and, you know, checking in,  are you okay?",253.642,259.423
SPEAKER_01,Or can you get a restraining order?,259.463,261.829
SPEAKER_01,"And my mom was trying to get me to move in with  her and, you know, it's just too many, you know, too many cooks in the kitchen.",262.01,271.117
SPEAKER_00,So a lot of people,271.418,272.2
SPEAKER_00, have some ideas about what you should be doing.,272.28,274.707
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,274.728,276.011
SPEAKER_01,"So I'm just really, I'm not, I'm not going to  do that.",276.052,279.242
SPEAKER_01,I'm not going to get a restraining order.,279.282,281.351
SPEAKER_01,I'm not going to call the police.,281.391,282.716
SPEAKER_01,"You know, he  knows where I live.",282.737,284.483
SPEAKER_00,So say more about that.,285.547,286.51
SPEAKER_00,"Say more about why you, why you don't want to call the  police or you don't want to get a restraining order.",286.571,291.45
SPEAKER_01,"They were, they were throwing him on the  ground.",291.772,293.961
SPEAKER_01,"They were holding his arms behind his back and, and they had their guns and, you know,  that kind of, you never know what the police are going to do to a black man.",295.144,306.254
SPEAKER_01,You never know whether  he's going to make it to the jail safely.,306.877,310.386
SPEAKER_01,"So I was, I was terrified for him.",311.208,313.514
SPEAKER_01,"And then the next day,  you know, child welfare call in the house.",314.717,318.566
SPEAKER_00,It sounds like that was a very scary experience and  moment for you.,320.17,325.784
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, because I'm a good mom.",325.804,327.95
SPEAKER_00,"And given that experience, you're, it sounds like you're  probably, you're maybe not as inclined to think about calling the police again.",329.514,336.374
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,336.394,336.474
SPEAKER_01,"No, no.",336.634,337.517
SPEAKER_01,"I've,  I've told my mom that that's, you know, that's a last resort and that I'm going to be meeting with  some folks and thinking about other options.",337.537,347.249
SPEAKER_00,"And that's what you'd like to talk about today,  is alternatives to calling the police.",348.574,352.569
SPEAKER_01,Absolutely.,352.77,353.352
SPEAKER_00,"Well, what have you thought about so far?",353.372,355.68
SPEAKER_00,"What  other ideas do you have about what you might do in a serious moment where you're scared for your,  your wellbeing and that of your kids?",355.74,367.443
SPEAKER_01,"I think I'm most afraid, you know, that something might happen  that will be really crazy and really out of control.",368.685,379.929
SPEAKER_01,And so I've been thinking about what  kinds of things I could do if things are crazy and out of control.,381.032,386.992
SPEAKER_01,And I've just thought about maybe  talking to somebody or talking to my minister about it.,387.012,393.952
SPEAKER_01,It came to my mind because he's somebody  who we've talked to before.,393.972,398.324
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,398.344,399.186
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,399.568,399.768
SPEAKER_00,"So your minister, someone that you're thinking about,  talking to a little bit about what's going on in your relationship.",399.848,407.754
SPEAKER_00,What are your thoughts?,408.497,409.139
SPEAKER_00,"What  would you, what would you say to your minister?",409.159,411.11
SPEAKER_00,What would you like to tell your minister?,411.13,412.819
SPEAKER_01,"I'm  really, I'm really interested in telling him more of the truth of what's happening in my relationship.",412.839,418.54
SPEAKER_01," He doesn't know about, he has no idea that Paul has threatened to kill me and they threatened to  kill himself and the children.",418.64,425.825
SPEAKER_01,"He knows we've had some marital problems, some financial problems.",426.99,429.5
SPEAKER_01, He knows that Paul's had some drinking problems.,430.724,433.051
SPEAKER_01,"So there's some of that, but he doesn't know about  him threatening to kill us or that he's been hitting me or his rages.",434.194,440.592
SPEAKER_01,"So I feel like, you know,  that it's time to tell the minister, you know, tell him some of that stuff.",441.935,447.735
SPEAKER_00,"You feel like you've  been keeping some significant information from your, what would be some reasons why you would  tell him these things?",448.538,457.486
SPEAKER_00,What might be some advantages or reasons to do that?,457.646,460.414
SPEAKER_01,He's been helpful before.,461.598,462.46
SPEAKER_01, He's really helped us a lot.,462.982,464.266
SPEAKER_01,"We've, we've had counseling with him over the last five years,  numerous times, and he's been very helpful.",464.326,471.931
SPEAKER_00,"So it's someone that you trust, someone that you",472.614,474.46
SPEAKER_00," have a relationship with, and he's been helpful.",474.46,476.949
SPEAKER_00,In what ways has he been helpful?,476.99,478.535
SPEAKER_01,"You know, I think  Paul respects him as a man and I think he cares about Paul.",479.158,484.934
SPEAKER_01,"So he's not, you know, my mom and my  dad and my friends, they, they're, they're really bordering on hating Paul and they don't, I don't  feel like they have any objectivity when it comes to working with him.",485.375,496.732
SPEAKER_01,But my pastor has some  objectivity and I think he cares about Paul.,498.036,501.367
SPEAKER_00,"It sounds like your pastor is able to see him as a  whole complicated human being in the same ways that, that you do, perhaps, that there's this side  of him that's scary and that you don't like, and then there's this other aspect of him that you,  you really do appreciate and you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well.",502.07,523.08
SPEAKER_00, What would be another reason to talk to your pastor in addition to this being someone you  trust and that Paul might listen to?,523.802,531.391
SPEAKER_00,What would be another advantage?,531.411,532.515
SPEAKER_01,"Well, I don't think that he's  going to likely go storming into, you know, our pastor's house.",532.555,537.974
SPEAKER_01,"Paul, Paul won't.",538.175,538.978
SPEAKER_01,"That Paul won't,  you know, he's going to, you know, he comes banging at my mom's door and he goes, you know,  storming over to my girlfriend's house, but he's not likely to do that.",539.038,549.291
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, I don't think he  will.",549.312,552.441
SPEAKER_00,"So, so, so your pastor's home actually might be a physically safe place for you all to go,",552.642,558.42
SPEAKER_01," right, should things get cool off because things got so out of control and crazy, you know, and,  and that's not going to happen again.",558.6,567.346
SPEAKER_00,So you've said that a few times now that things got so out  of control and crazy.,567.868,572.365
SPEAKER_00,"Tell me, tell me a little bit more about how, what that was.",572.465,577.078
SPEAKER_01,"You know, you  know, my eldest son got involved.",577.278,580.706
SPEAKER_01,"My arm was, was, was harmed.",581.488,583.813
SPEAKER_01,Things were broken.,583.834,585.457
SPEAKER_01,He threatened to  kill me and he threatened to kill all of us.,586.159,589.969
SPEAKER_01,"And I had to call the police and I had to, you know,  have people coming into my house, tromping through my house, grabbing Paul, hurting him.",591.372,599.9
SPEAKER_01," You know, he called me from jail and how can you do this?",600.02,603.853
SPEAKER_01,"You know, what have you done?",603.973,604.936
SPEAKER_01,"You know,  I felt like, what have I done?",604.956,607.384
SPEAKER_01,How can I do this?,607.404,609.049
SPEAKER_00,Right.,609.369,609.771
SPEAKER_00,"So, so not only was it so scary in the heat  of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your children, but afterwards it was  scary as well because of all the things that happened.",609.851,621.569
SPEAKER_01,All that fallout.,621.91,622.732
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,623.714,624.035
SPEAKER_00,"So, so, so  going to your pastors, talking to your pastor, possibly seeing if his house might be a place  that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore.",624.537,635.697
SPEAKER_00,And those are advantages.,635.737,636.62
SPEAKER_00, Are there any disadvantages?,636.72,638.186
SPEAKER_00,Like what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your  pastor about what's been going on in your relationship?,638.326,644.952
SPEAKER_01,That Paul will know.,645.534,646.418
SPEAKER_01,"You know,  if he finds out that I've talked to our minister about this, you know, I have no doubt how angry  he will be.",646.438,656.822
SPEAKER_00,"So this could really be a trigger, a significant trigger.",657.665,660.936
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, if he finds out about  it.",661.377,662.621
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,663.042,663.444
SPEAKER_00,So that's a little bit of a difficult situation.,664.487,666.753
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,666.774,666.854
SPEAKER_00,"As you think about this  particular part of a safety plan, on the one hand, there's potentially some real advantages  and positives to speaking to your minister.",667.255,678.71
SPEAKER_00,"And at the same time, there's this possible significant  risk.",678.85,683.744
SPEAKER_00,"When you think about, you know, the pros and the cons in this situation, what do you,  what do you make of that?",685.849,693.086
SPEAKER_00,"What do you, where do you go with that?",693.167,695.475
SPEAKER_01,"It's, it's a risk I'm willing  to take.",695.635,697.541
SPEAKER_01,"You know, I have thought about this and it was, you know, things got so out of control  and I feel like it's time to do something different and to think about how we're going to do this  differently.",698.162,713.901
SPEAKER_00,"You're, you're really concerned.",715.565,718.331
SPEAKER_00,Yes.,718.732,719.173
SPEAKER_00,A part of you is really worried about the next  time.,719.213,722.581
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,722.601,724.426
SPEAKER_00,"And you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of the safety planning  and you also feel like it's a risk that you're, you're willing to take given what is at stake.",724.446,735.7
SPEAKER_00, And really it sounds like you feel like your life and your children's lives may be at stake.,735.961,740.099
SPEAKER_00,Yes.,740.119,740.28
SPEAKER_01," You know, I think that things can't continue the way that they are.",741.001,747.354
SPEAKER_01,I have to figure out something  that's going to work for me and for my kids and for Paul.,747.374,753.088
SPEAKER_00,"Would it be alright with you if I  offered just a suggestion or a thought, something to think about in terms of kids and safety  planning?",755.836,762.902
SPEAKER_00,Yes.,762.922,763.684
SPEAKER_00,"This is something that I know other moms in a similar, in situations similar to yours  have done and that is sit down and have a conversation with their kids about identifying a  safe person to either call or run to in the moment when things are, if things get really crazy and  out of hand.",763.744,785.044
SPEAKER_00,I'd be curious to hear what your thoughts are about doing that with your kids.,785.064,789.599
SPEAKER_01," I think my oldest, my oldest son, that would be a really helpful thing for him because he wants to  know what he can do.",790.061,797.845
SPEAKER_01,He wants to do something.,797.865,799.07
SPEAKER_01,He's always jumping in.,799.491,800.556
SPEAKER_01,That's how I got hurt in the  first place is he was jumping in.,800.596,803.144
SPEAKER_01,So helping him identify something that he can do that will keep  us safe and to keep him safe would be a great idea.,804.208,811.809
SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, so you see this perhaps as a way of  kind of not pulling him out of a violent situation but having him turn away from a violent situation  as opposed to turn into it which is what he's done.",811.829,826.028
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, he's becoming a man now too.",826.389,828.535
SPEAKER_01,He needs to have an option of  what he can do to keep his family safe.,828.635,832.325
SPEAKER_00,"And as he's becoming a man and thinking about how to protect  you, you're also really concerned about protecting him and keeping him safe.",834.009,844.135
SPEAKER_00,I've heard you identify  a few things that you're thinking about doing or would like to do and things that you feel like you  actually do have control over.,844.978,856.568
SPEAKER_00,Last time we talked you were very clear about the fact that  you can't control Paul when he's in his fury and his rage and being violent.,857.49,868.216
SPEAKER_00,And what I've heard  you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control.,869.038,875.437
SPEAKER_00,"You can't control him  but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to  possibly a safe person, your minister and having that conversation to see if that might be a safe  person and place to go to and then the other piece is maybe having a conversation with your oldest  child at least about who to call in the moment.",875.457,898.148
SPEAKER_00,And I'm confident Vanessa that you will be able  to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and I'm here to support you in any way  that I can and if it's at all helpful I'd be happy to follow up with you in a few days and see if you  feel the need to talk about it some more.,899.852,917.108
SPEAKER_01,Thank you I'd appreciate that.,917.53,919.056
SPEAKER_00,Thanks for your time.,919.357,920.02
SPEAKER_01, Thank you.,920.02,920.27
