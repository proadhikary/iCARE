SPEAKER_00, OK.,600.8,600.9

SPEAKER_00,And I think I can appreciate that.,661.184,662.739
SPEAKER_00," I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor, that sometimes meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful.",664.721,677.76
SPEAKER_00, Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment?,677.8,679.8
