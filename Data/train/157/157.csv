SPEAKER_00,"I know  last time we talked, you and Kelly had just gotten engaged and you were rather excited about plans that you had for your life.",55.976,68.167
SPEAKER_00,So tell me what has happened?,68.307,69.53
SPEAKER_00,What has shifted?,69.55,71.494
SPEAKER_01,"I think that we've  just sort of fallen back, you know?",71.514,76.586
SPEAKER_01,"I was really hopeful that with the proposal also came the promise to  work on the relationship and work on her anger and work on, you know, being the couple that we hope to be.",76.887,92.68
SPEAKER_01, And that's not happening.,93.763,96.531
SPEAKER_01,It's not happening.,96.551,97.514
SPEAKER_01,We're right back to where we were.,97.554,98.757
SPEAKER_00,I'm sorry to hear  that.,98.878,100.061
SPEAKER_00,I know you were excited.,100.181,102.367
SPEAKER_00,You were feeling hopeful for change and I don't get that same  sense from you right now.,102.408,108.184
SPEAKER_00,"In fact, it seems like you're feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless about the situation.",108.244,115.686
SPEAKER_00,"Well, how can I be helpful and supportive and useful to you right  now?",116.107,122.381
SPEAKER_01,"I just, I don't know how to make change.",124.106,126.272
SPEAKER_01,I don't know how to end this.,126.312,127.295
SPEAKER_01,I don't know how to  get out.,127.315,129.561
SPEAKER_01,"I don't know how to, I just, I can't do it anymore.",129.602,133.034
SPEAKER_00,So you've decided to make a change.,133.535,134.9
SPEAKER_00," And in fact, it sounds like you've decided to leave the relationship.",134.9,138.353
SPEAKER_01,I don't know.,139.276,139.758
SPEAKER_01,"I mean,  I want to, I don't want to be in it, but I don't, I don't know how to get to not being in it.",139.778,149.038
SPEAKER_00,So  you're thinking about it.,149.92,151.105
SPEAKER_00,"It's not that you've committed or decided that you absolutely want  to leave the relationship, but correct me if I'm wrong.",151.165,157.131
SPEAKER_00,What you're saying is you want to make a  change and you don't want this relationship as it is right now.,157.171,164.894
SPEAKER_00,"What, what are you, when you think  about changing, what, what ideas, I mean, I guess you mentioned leaving.",165.616,171.473
SPEAKER_00,What other possibilities  or thoughts have you had about change and what that might look like?,172.756,178.051
SPEAKER_01,I don't know.,180.117,180.638
SPEAKER_01,It just feels  so overwhelming when I think about it.,180.658,183.124
SPEAKER_01,"I just, I can't seem to find a way out of it.",183.224,188.458
SPEAKER_01,"And that feels,  feels ethical.",188.598,191.967
SPEAKER_01,"It feels like it, you know, I don't want to hurt her.",191.987,194.514
SPEAKER_01,I just don't want to be  in this relationship anymore.,194.534,197.985
SPEAKER_00,Why don't you want to be in this relationship anymore?,198.828,200.855
SPEAKER_01,It's not  healthy.,201.979,202.742
SPEAKER_01,It's I'm not happy.,202.762,204.247
SPEAKER_01,"I can't imagine that she's happy, even though she says she is.",204.267,207.096
SPEAKER_01,"It's,  you know, we're fighting constantly.",207.117,210.828
SPEAKER_01,I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her.,210.848,213.116
SPEAKER_01,She's  overprotective.,213.136,215.545
SPEAKER_01,"She, yeah, it just, it doesn't feel right.",215.665,218.855
SPEAKER_01,It just doesn't feel right.,218.935,219.919
SPEAKER_00,It doesn't  feel right.,219.979,221.001
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,221.021,221.822
SPEAKER_00,"And so, so what would feel right?",222.784,227.07
SPEAKER_01,"Oh, that's a huge question.",229.173,231.697
SPEAKER_01,"I just don't,  I'm not sure.",231.717,237.928
SPEAKER_01,Just this isn't right.,238.169,239.11
SPEAKER_00,So the way things are is not right.,240.533,242.677
SPEAKER_00,It's not working.,242.918,243.839
SPEAKER_00,You  don't feel supported.,243.859,245.305
SPEAKER_00,"This isn't the kind of relationship that, that you want or that you  had hoped that it would be.",245.365,250.346
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,250.366,250.446
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, when we started, it was, it was lovely.",250.566,253.498
SPEAKER_01,She was amazing.,253.638,254.08
SPEAKER_01, She was this super caring and thoughtful woman.,254.621,257.369
SPEAKER_01,"And, you know, we were lots of same interests,  same friends.",257.489,262.743
SPEAKER_01,"It's, you know, she was just fantastic.",262.843,265.612
SPEAKER_01,"And I don't know, I don't know where  that changed.",265.672,268.962
SPEAKER_01,"And I feel like we did this on again, off again stuff.",269.023,271.331
SPEAKER_01,"And it was just, it just seems  to like, it's just not right.",271.411,275.706
SPEAKER_01,"And I know, I know I don't deserve to be treated this way.",275.726,279.477
SPEAKER_01,I know that  I'm better than that.,279.497,281.522
SPEAKER_00,You really value your self and your well being and in your spirit.,283.465,288.192
SPEAKER_00,And it  sounds like you don't feel like you're taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship.,288.212,299.54
SPEAKER_00," And even though things started out well, they haven't turned out to be the kind of relationship  that you want for yourself.",299.821,309.887
SPEAKER_01,"No, but you know, but she's lovely.",309.907,314.276
SPEAKER_01,And I love her.,314.336,315.418
SPEAKER_01,"And I can't imagine,  I can't imagine my life without her in it.",315.458,319.068
SPEAKER_00,So you're feeling torn.,319.088,320.894
SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, you're, you're torn  between your love and affection for her, and your sense of honoring yourself.",320.914,330.39
SPEAKER_00,And you've got a lot  of mixed feelings.,330.411,338.884
SPEAKER_00,And you are saying that you need something to change.,340.047,344.678
SPEAKER_00,"That sounds like you're  able to kind of hold that complexity, if you will, that you've got these strong feelings for this  person.",345.119,353.141
SPEAKER_00,And you don't feel like this is the good relationship for you.,355.006,358.754
SPEAKER_01,No.,359.255,359.496
SPEAKER_01,I don't think it's good for  either one of us.,359.516,362.142
SPEAKER_00,For both of you.,362.925,363.647
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,363.667,363.747
SPEAKER_00,"Well, so so then you've talked a little bit about leaving.",365.492,368.08
SPEAKER_00," I mean, tell me more about what you've thought about.",368.12,371.574
SPEAKER_00,"And when you think about making a change  in terms of leaving, what what might that look like for you?",371.634,376.549
SPEAKER_01,I don't know.,376.569,379.798
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, it feels,  I just can't imagine my life without her in it.",379.818,386.353
SPEAKER_01,So the idea of not having her there feels really  scary.,386.553,389.921
SPEAKER_01,"And the idea of staying the way it is, and things not changing, feels even scarier.",389.941,397.416
SPEAKER_01,"So I don't,  I don't know how to, and I don't even know how I would do that.",398.699,402.032
SPEAKER_01,Our lives are so intertwined.,402.072,403.699
SPEAKER_01,I,403.719,403.739
SPEAKER_01," mean, my business, our friends, the queer community is so small.",404.802,409.395
SPEAKER_01,"You know, that's my family.",409.415,410.999
SPEAKER_01,Those are  not just my friends.,411.019,412.062
SPEAKER_01,That's my family as well.,412.123,413.848
SPEAKER_01,"And so it just, you know, how do you, how do you  extract yourself from that, in a way, you know, for me, like, in a way that I feel that I'm doing  that with grace and respect for her and respect for myself.",413.908,428.272
SPEAKER_00,What thoughts do you have about how  you do that?,429.115,431.602
SPEAKER_00,How do you extract yourself?,431.662,433.007
SPEAKER_00,"How might you extract yourself in a way that has  some integrity and grace, as you said?",433.088,439.429
SPEAKER_01,I don't even know.,439.449,441.134
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, I've talked to my friend Jay  about it.",441.154,443.682
SPEAKER_01,"And I don't know, he suggested like a break, but I don't know.",443.762,448.818
SPEAKER_01,"I just don't want to get  caught in that on again, off again before, like, you know, like we've done before.",448.858,453.975
SPEAKER_01,"But the idea of  a break feels a little less, I don't know, maybe more gentle.",454.998,459.751
SPEAKER_01,I don't know.,459.771,461.656
SPEAKER_00,"Say more, a little more  gentle.",461.817,463.622
SPEAKER_01,"I don't know, to give us both time to really think about it.",465.988,468.455
SPEAKER_01,"And I don't know, maybe,  maybe she'll change.",468.595,472.826
SPEAKER_01,"Maybe, maybe if I'm, you know, if this is it, if this is it, like if this break  is it maybe, maybe she'll be able to change.",472.926,481.787
SPEAKER_00,"I heard you say that living, you know, moving on and  having a life without Kelly is really scary.",483.671,490.01
SPEAKER_00,"In fact, it's almost impossible for you to imagine  what that would look like, especially with the way that your lives are so intertwined.",490.05,497.836
SPEAKER_00,I also  heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier.,497.856,503.413
SPEAKER_00,And I was wondering if you  could say a little bit more about what you mean by that.,503.433,509.05
SPEAKER_01,"It's just, I feel exhausted.",509.07,512.158
SPEAKER_01,"I feel like  I'm not, I'm not who I was when I came into this relationship.",512.178,518.615
SPEAKER_01,I feel like I'm constantly struggling  to make her happy and that just doesn't work.,518.696,523.509
SPEAKER_01,There's nothing I can do.,523.85,525.034
SPEAKER_01,And I feel like I've  lost my joy.,525.976,530.106
SPEAKER_01,And I don't know.,530.126,531.79
SPEAKER_01,I'm just afraid of what will happen if I just keep staying in a place  where I feel like I'm falling apart.,531.81,540.05
SPEAKER_01,Piece by piece.,540.07,542.055
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,542.235,542.596
SPEAKER_00,"So you're concerned about your own  well being and your own joy and your, your spirit if you you stay and don't make this change.",542.656,550.86
SPEAKER_00,And  that's the part that's really scary for you.,550.9,553.408
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,553.428,553.508
SPEAKER_00,You mentioned that your friend suggested  possibly taking a little break.,554.632,559.928
SPEAKER_00,And you said that that was a scary thought for you.,560.67,562.976
SPEAKER_00,And I guess I'd  like to hear more additional thoughts you might have about that as a as an option for you.,563.117,570.477
SPEAKER_01,"Well,  I did.",571.4,572.062
SPEAKER_01,"It seems like I mean, if it could happen, if we could find a way to make it happen that it  would be it would just give me some time to think about like what I want and what I need and and you  know, I feel like I can't sort out what's me in this anymore.",572.302,592.814
SPEAKER_01,"And, and so like if I had that space  just to sort of breathe and not have to worry about her feelings and taking care of her and  just being able to focus on myself for a little while.",593.936,604.03
SPEAKER_01,I don't know it seems like that would be  helpful.,604.05,607.241
SPEAKER_00,"It sounds like you're feeling like you're so in, in it just so in the mixed emotions and  the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it's really hard for you to  see out of it and an advantage, a reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to  breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence, if you will,  that sense of not knowing.",607.803,636.346
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,636.547,636.968
SPEAKER_00,"Well, if you don't mind, I'd love to ask you to take a look at this  ruler here.",637.61,641.343
SPEAKER_00,I just kind of wrote this down really quickly.,641.403,643.129
SPEAKER_00,"But on a scale of zero to 10, zero being  not motivated at all and 10 being extremely motivated.",643.169,649.653
SPEAKER_00,How motivated would you say you are  to take a break in your relationship right now?,650.034,655.668
SPEAKER_01,"Oh, like six? ",657.03,661.358
SPEAKER_00,"Six? Oh, somewhat motivated?",,
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,661.378,662.16
SPEAKER_00,Why  a six and not a one?,662.2,664.986
SPEAKER_01,Because I know it needs I need it.,667.03,668.514
SPEAKER_01,I feel like I'm losing myself.,669.215,670.839
SPEAKER_01,So I feel  like it's important.,670.939,673.084
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,673.424,673.845
SPEAKER_00,"Well, so So why six and not a nine or 10?",674.066,678.295
SPEAKER_01,Because I'm not sure how  to make it happen.,680.058,681.822
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, I don't I don't know.",683.766,685.17
SPEAKER_00,So it's important to you.,686.152,687.675
SPEAKER_00,And you're not maybe fully  confident or sure about the how part.,688.457,692.688
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,692.768,693.731
SPEAKER_00,"Well, kind of following up on that on a scale of zero to  10, zero being not confident at all.",694.433,699.387
SPEAKER_00,10 being extremely confident.,699.407,701.715
SPEAKER_00,"How confident are you that  if you decided to take a break from relationship with Kelly, you would be successful at making that  happen?",701.775,709.901
SPEAKER_01,"Oh, I don't know, maybe like a three or four.",711.586,713.933
SPEAKER_00,"Okay, so so less confident, a little less  confident than you are motivated.",713.953,717.984
SPEAKER_00,Why a three and not a zero?,718.365,721.032
SPEAKER_01,"Because I, I want it.",722.235,723.799
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, I do.",723.919,724.26
SPEAKER_01, It's something I want.,724.481,726.024
SPEAKER_00,And so wanting it makes you feel confident that you confident to some extent  that you could actually make it happen.,727.407,734.806
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,735.047,735.348
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,736.07,736.311
SPEAKER_00,Why Why three and not an eight or a nine?,736.652,738.86
SPEAKER_01, I can't control her.,739.14,743.81
SPEAKER_01,I don't know how she would react.,743.91,745.293
SPEAKER_01,And I just don't want any more arguments  and anger.,745.373,749.301
SPEAKER_01,"And yeah, and I don't want to hurt her.",749.422,752.529
SPEAKER_01,So.,752.829,753.15
SPEAKER_00,"So when you think about taking this break,  you're also thinking about how she might respond and what she might do.",754.353,762.095
SPEAKER_00,And that creates this whole  other kind of set of worries.,762.216,766.247
SPEAKER_00,And it undermines your sense of confidence on some level.,766.267,770.457
SPEAKER_01,It creates  a lot of anxiety for me.,770.477,772.925
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,773.125,773.306
SPEAKER_00,What do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel  more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break?,773.969,783.132
SPEAKER_01,"I think I like maybe a plan,  like just knowing, knowing what the rules are sort of like where, where, where I want to go  with it and what I'm, I don't know what I want to accomplish.",784.715,798.391
SPEAKER_00,"So thinking through an actual plan,  like what you would say, how long, what the boundaries are, might, might help you.",799.033,807.258
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,807.278,807.359
SPEAKER_01, In that regard.,807.84,808.442
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,808.462,808.843
SPEAKER_00,"And then one final question on a scale of zero to 10, zero being not ready  at all and 10 being extremely ready.",809.285,816.726
SPEAKER_00,"How ready would you say you are to commit to taking some  kind of brief break in the, let's say the next couple of weeks?",817.167,826.39
SPEAKER_01,I think an eight.,828.274,829.938
SPEAKER_00,An eight?,830.098,830.439
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,830.64,830.76
SPEAKER_00," So, so pretty ready.",830.981,832.425
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,832.446,833.188
SPEAKER_00,"And, and you've spoken to this already a little bit, I believe, but I'll  ask you again, why an eight and not a one or a two?",833.73,840.711
SPEAKER_01,"Because I know if I just let it drag out,  that I'm going to be miserable.",841.815,845.065
SPEAKER_00,So your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your  motivation.,846.128,851.225
SPEAKER_00,That is that this is something you know that you need to do for yourself.,851.245,855.938
SPEAKER_00,"And if  you don't, things are not going to get any better.",856.259,859.45
SPEAKER_00,"And that, that makes you both motivated and even  more ready.",859.771,863.463
SPEAKER_00,"Well, why, why an eight and not a 10?",864.304,866.509
SPEAKER_01,"That's, you know, scary.",866.549,870.017
SPEAKER_01,Change is hard.,870.518,871.32
SPEAKER_01,"And  thinking about not being with a woman, I thought I was going to marry.",871.36,876.871
SPEAKER_01,"It's sad, makes me sad.",876.891,880.158
SPEAKER_00,So,880.178,880.218
SPEAKER_00," your emotions, your sense of maybe sadness and, and grief and disappointment around this detract  from your sense of readiness in some way.",881.22,892.847
SPEAKER_01,Sort of giving up on a dream.,892.867,895.012
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,895.032,896.976
SPEAKER_00,"And so another  aspect then to your whole experience is that you're, you're grieving.",897.016,901.832
SPEAKER_00,"The relationship isn't  even over yet, but you're grieving the dream and the hopes that you had.",901.852,909.135
SPEAKER_00,"And that's a, that's a  heaviness and certainly a factor in, in what you do next.",909.155,914.932
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,915.474,915.815
SPEAKER_00,"Well, if I could take just a moment  and make sure I've captured and understood everything you've shared with me.",915.835,920.856
SPEAKER_00,"And I, I know  this is really difficult to talk about.",920.916,923.667
SPEAKER_00,"So I really appreciate you spending the time to share  with me what, what this has been like for you.",923.708,929.867
SPEAKER_00,You've been feeling stuck and things were great  for a while.,931.872,935.962
SPEAKER_00,You had some hope that things were going to change.,936.023,938.15
