SPEAKER_00,14.218,15.24," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."
SPEAKER_00,15.681,17.234, I hope you find this video useful.
SPEAKER_00,17.96,20.956," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_00,21.76,23.087," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,28.09,33.497," Would you be okay now, kind of taking a look at some of your thinking,  and let's look at the situation from that point of view?"
SPEAKER_01,33.96,34.246, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,36.243,44.699, Some things kind of stand out for me in hearing you talk about what's been happening and your feelings.
SPEAKER_00,46.024,58.45," I can appreciate it's really painful, and I would say,  to the degree that you can step back and try to look at the thoughts,  I think that you'll see it's helpful."
SPEAKER_00,59.94,66.496, Although I know it's a little difficult or unusual to separate feelings from thoughts sometimes.
SPEAKER_00,68.0,71.518, But I'd like to try to kind of distinguish between the two.
SPEAKER_01,71.96,72.246, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,73.422,75.855, You said that you've been at your job for about five years.
SPEAKER_00,76.94,77.627, You really like your job?
SPEAKER_01,79.304,80.031," I used to, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,80.96,88.699," Tell me about your job, kind of how you felt about it,  but frame it in a time before this ever happened."
SPEAKER_01,89.183,89.587, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,90.96,94.896," I like my job because I felt like I was helping people, so it was meaningful."
SPEAKER_01,95.92,101.977," And when I went there, the time went by fast, so it was kind of like I was enjoying myself."
SPEAKER_01,102.92,116.137," Not super fast, I wasn't having the best time of my life, but it was something where I would go,  and I felt like I was doing something important, and the day didn't drag on,  and I got along with my co-workers and that kind of thing."
SPEAKER_01,116.94,119.875," So, it felt meaningful to me."
SPEAKER_00,120.92,121.323, Meaningful.
SPEAKER_00,124.201,132.537," So, do you remember accomplishing things at that job that you felt benefited society, the people you helped?"
SPEAKER_01,133.92,143.134," Yeah, I feel like, you know, doing my job, I got to know people, you know, help people out with things that they needed."
SPEAKER_01,146.92,155.256," You know, when things were bad, I could, you know, get kids out of situations that were really dangerous for them,  and, you know, no one else was going to do that for them."
SPEAKER_01,155.92,162.835," I felt like I was the kind of person that was keeping people safe, I guess."
SPEAKER_00,165.202,166.088, You kept people safe.
SPEAKER_00,168.321,172.613, And you had a lot of satisfaction from the work you did.
SPEAKER_00,175.422,179.057," And now, it doesn't feel that way?"
SPEAKER_01,180.121,181.269," No, not at all."
SPEAKER_00,182.92,189.775," The way you described it, it almost sounds like you, well, you talked about how you're afraid of making another mistake."
SPEAKER_00,192.221,198.76, You're thinking about yourself in a way where you're almost at risk to have...
SPEAKER_01,198.92,205.635," Yeah, I was just about to say, it feels dangerous to be there, like to do my job, it feels dangerous."
SPEAKER_00,208.221,220.494," Your work right now, even though you have this one situation that's extremely stressful and hard on you,  you have other families that you interact with now too, right?"
SPEAKER_00,222.001,223.148, Can you tell me about those interactions?
SPEAKER_01,225.582,238.178," I mean, I guess it's like quantitatively the same as before, I do the same things with families,  but now I kind of feel like I can't trust my own judgement."
SPEAKER_01,240.346,252.597," Before, everything just kind of felt a little more black and white,  and now it just feels like everything is so much a shade of grey that I just can't tell what's right and what's wrong anymore."
SPEAKER_01,254.04,265.92," And every time I feel like I have a good instinct, I doubt it, I question it,  I think I have ideas of, well, if I remove the kids from this family, what if they're not really doing the things I think they're doing?"
SPEAKER_01,266.161,268.228," Like, what if the parents are actually good parents?"
SPEAKER_01,268.268,271.238,What if the kids get put into a home that's bad for them?
SPEAKER_00,273.505,281.794," So before, this is maybe what's different, based on what you're saying, from before till now,  is decisions seemed clear-cut."
SPEAKER_01,283.842,299.76," Yeah, sometimes it was tougher than others, but it just seemed more like I could make a decision and kind of wipe my hands of it and move on to the next thing,  and now I just feel like there's all these doubts in my head and all these questions about if I'm doing the right thing."
SPEAKER_00,303.366,303.666, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,304.067,329.252,"So you're looking inward, you're looking at yourself, a lot of self-doubt,  you're looking at decisions as much more difficult, it's much more difficult to come to the right decision,  and second-guessing, it sounds like maybe you're second-guessing a bit, when you do make a decision,  like playing over it in your mind, what could go wrong here?"
SPEAKER_00,329.272,331.82,Is that the thought you're having?
SPEAKER_01,332.201,333.647," Yeah, yeah, definitely."
SPEAKER_01,333.667,336.217,I feel like I'm second-guessing everything.
