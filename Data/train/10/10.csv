SPEAKER_00," Hi there, Ms.",0.0,0.221
SPEAKER_00,Stone.,0.241,0.341
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,7.0,7.061
SPEAKER_00," Hi, I'm BJ Daniels.",10.068,10.47
SPEAKER_00," Sorry, let me wash my hands.",13.201,16.173
SPEAKER_01, Just call me Dorothy.,18.0,19.939
SPEAKER_00," Oh, thank you.",20.0,20.49
SPEAKER_00, That's the next thing I was going to ask you.,21.586,23.0
SPEAKER_00," So Dorothy, the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care.",23.682,29.0
SPEAKER_00, But what's going on?,29.768,30.434
SPEAKER_01," Five days ago, I was admitted to emergency, and they treated me by putting this tube down my throat.",31.942,39.699
SPEAKER_01, And I tried to tell them and gesture to them that I don't want this tube down my throat.,40.481,46.338
SPEAKER_01, And I just hope that never happens again.,48.246,50.417
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,51.02,51.408
SPEAKER_00," No, I totally understand that.",52.02,53.576
SPEAKER_00," I mean, that is quite a scary thing to go through.",54.02,55.919
SPEAKER_00," And I think we do need to talk about this more, and I'm glad that you've asked to talk to me about this.",56.683,60.92
SPEAKER_00," So I had a little bit of a look through your chart, so I think I understand why they did it.",61.944,66.0
SPEAKER_00, But did anybody explain it to you?,66.141,67.792
SPEAKER_01," Well, not really, because I was gasping for air in the state I was.",69.582,75.98
SPEAKER_01," But I'll tell you what, I'm really worried that this won't happen to me again.",76.662,82.799
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,83.429,83.633
SPEAKER_01, I don't want that tube anymore.,84.664,86.376
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,87.082,87.551
SPEAKER_01, I'm okay to pass as I am.,88.322,91.296
SPEAKER_00, Absolutely.,92.408,92.898
SPEAKER_00, And you know what?,93.0,93.429
SPEAKER_00, There's no right answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive like the tube.,94.462,98.88
SPEAKER_00, We really want to know what the patient values in terms of things that are that invasive.,99.261,105.0
SPEAKER_00, And so absolutely we'll respect whatever it is that you want.,105.643,108.638
SPEAKER_00, But I do need to find out a little bit more about you in terms of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital?,109.661,116.837
SPEAKER_01," Well, I have congestive heart failure.",118.544,120.96
SPEAKER_01, And I guess there was water in my lungs and stopping me from breathing properly.,121.963,127.92
SPEAKER_01," So I was living in my, so the ambulance brought me in to the emergency.",128.842,135.038
SPEAKER_01, So that was how they were treating me.,136.321,140.217
SPEAKER_00, So you pretty much showed up to emergency and very quickly they put that tube down.,141.663,146.0
SPEAKER_01, That's correct.,146.469,147.0
SPEAKER_00, Did anybody ask you if you were okay with that?,147.403,149.537
SPEAKER_01," Well, I tried to gesture to them that I don't want the tube, but...",150.662,154.676
SPEAKER_00, They didn't quite pick up on that.,156.768,158.0
SPEAKER_01, I guess not.,158.465,159.131
SPEAKER_01," And you know, I've had that three times already and I don't want to go through that again.",160.161,164.418
SPEAKER_00, The tube you've had down three times?,165.646,166.96
SPEAKER_01," Yes, yes.",167.265,167.898
SPEAKER_00," Oh wow, okay.",168.306,168.837
SPEAKER_01," Yes, I don't want it anymore.",169.0,170.313
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,172.044,172.205
SPEAKER_00,And so you have congestive heart failure and it sounds like you've had a breathing problem.,172.426,175.558
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,176.02,176.102
SPEAKER_00, And do you know why they would have put the tube down?,177.04,178.168
SPEAKER_00,Do you know what they were trying to do?,178.289,179.356
SPEAKER_01, I guess because I was short of air.,180.481,182.968
SPEAKER_01,I had a hard time breathing.,184.573,186.198
SPEAKER_01," So they tried to, I'm going to use the word save me.",187.602,191.297
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like you understand that.,192.727,194.0
SPEAKER_00," I mean, usually we only put a tube in if that was the only thing we could do to save you.",194.201,200.639
SPEAKER_00, Most of the time a congestive heart failure will give some medications.,201.523,204.759
SPEAKER_00, Have you heard of Lasix or furosemide?,205.564,207.698
SPEAKER_01, No.,209.333,209.596
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,210.0,210.221
SPEAKER_00,It's a medication we'll often give if someone is in heart failure.,210.523,213.98
SPEAKER_00," But if someone is really sick and then we don't think we have time to give it,  that's the time we would think of a breathing tube.",214.482,220.899
SPEAKER_00," I haven't had chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in.",221.662,228.739
SPEAKER_01, I guess so.,230.145,232.052
SPEAKER_01,But I'm okay with dying.,232.896,233.92
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,234.0,234.224
SPEAKER_01," You know, like I said, I've lived a good life.",235.242,237.94
SPEAKER_01," And if the good Lord says that it's my time, I'm okay with that.",238.682,243.639
SPEAKER_01, And you wouldn't put a tube down my throat.,244.603,247.92
SPEAKER_00, No.,248.181,248.322
SPEAKER_00,"Already what I'm hearing from you, I'm just going to say exactly what you said.",248.503,251.98
SPEAKER_00, It sounds like you've lived a good life.,252.121,253.611
SPEAKER_00,You've been through this a few times.,254.013,255.0
SPEAKER_00, You know exactly what it involves.,255.364,257.0
SPEAKER_00," And if I could paraphrase to you, quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage.",257.943,263.92
SPEAKER_00, Is that correct?,264.041,264.959
SPEAKER_01, That is correct.,265.525,266.354
SPEAKER_01," But you know what, Doctor?",268.172,269.0
SPEAKER_01, How can I be assured that my wishes are respected so I don't get this tube down?,269.702,277.0
SPEAKER_00, That's an excellent question.,277.342,279.05
SPEAKER_00,So first I did want to answer your previous question.,279.07,281.0
SPEAKER_00," Based on what we're talking about, absolutely I agree with you that it is your wish and we will respect that wish,  that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again.",281.0,290.899
SPEAKER_00," And then of course your second question, which is great as well, is how do we make sure this doesn't happen?",291.744,294.98
SPEAKER_01," Absolutely, yeah.",295.0,295.571
SPEAKER_00," So what I'm going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions to ask you,  but after our conversation I write a note documenting what we talked about,  that we talked about the breathing tube and your reasons for why you don't want it,  which of course makes sense to me.",296.02,309.697
SPEAKER_00, And then what I do is I document a short form called Goals of Care.,310.302,313.98
SPEAKER_00," And I, just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds they know exactly what you want.",314.02,320.0
SPEAKER_00, We will give you a copy of that to take home.,320.846,322.839
SPEAKER_00, But I find that's not usually enough.,323.606,325.0
SPEAKER_00," What we also do, what I do, is I tend to, when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor.",325.682,332.0
SPEAKER_00, And that note's actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta.,333.004,336.92
SPEAKER_00, And in that note it will very clearly state you and I had this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing tube.,337.02,345.0
SPEAKER_00," So I'll reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that tube, okay?",345.441,352.0
SPEAKER_01," Oh, thank you.",353.365,354.189
SPEAKER_01,I was so concerned about that.,355.353,356.94
SPEAKER_01, And yes.,357.3,360.225
SPEAKER_01,"I think I will rest now because, like I say, that was a horrendous experience and you said it won't happen again.",361.767,369.72
SPEAKER_00, I do want to ask you just a few other questions related to this.,371.246,373.678
SPEAKER_01, Go ahead.,374.0,374.306
SPEAKER_00," And the first question might sound a little off-putting, but I sort of have to ask it.",375.0,381.619
SPEAKER_00," Anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want, we do have to ask, how is your mood?",382.0,389.293
SPEAKER_00,How are you feeling?,390.195,390.856
SPEAKER_01, I'm feeling fine.,394.003,395.046
SPEAKER_01,My mood is fine.,396.55,397.553
SPEAKER_01,I have no problems.,397.573,399.86
SPEAKER_00," Okay, excellent.",400.02,400.823
SPEAKER_00,And how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital?,401.265,404.98
SPEAKER_00," Like when you're healthy, as healthy as you can be, say a few weeks ago.",405.381,409.334
SPEAKER_01, I think I am enjoying life.,411.321,413.487
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, I am enjoying life to the best I can.",414.41,417.539
SPEAKER_00," Okay, great.",418.04,418.721
SPEAKER_00,And then other related questions.,420.204,421.727
SPEAKER_00,"We did talk about the tube that we wouldn't put it in, but again, we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want.",422.208,428.74
SPEAKER_00," So if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better, is that something you'd be willing to have?",429.261,434.98
SPEAKER_01, Certainly.,435.542,436.043
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, I'll look at medication, just not the intubation.",436.385,440.759
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,441.08,441.22
SPEAKER_00,"And then usually along the lines with the intubation, when people don't want the intubation, we often also want to know if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck, you had passed away, or if someone just found you at home, you had passed away, would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks, trying to bring you back to life?",441.681,461.0
SPEAKER_01, No.,461.922,462.103
SPEAKER_00,No.,462.704,463.426
SPEAKER_01,"Like I said, the good Lord knows when it's my time.",463.466,468.88
SPEAKER_00," No, and that all makes sense to me with the no breathing tube.",469.02,471.98
SPEAKER_01," Yes, and I have no problems with that.",472.0,473.556
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,474.561,475.844
SPEAKER_00,"There are some other things we can do that's not a breathing tube, but they're a little aggressive.",476.004,480.334
SPEAKER_00,"And one is, have you ever heard of BiPAP?",480.875,482.699
SPEAKER_01, I don't think so.,484.273,484.98
SPEAKER_00, It's a mask that really pushes air into you.,485.781,488.786
SPEAKER_00,"It's a little uncomfortable, but nothing as bad as a breathing tube.",488.806,492.312
SPEAKER_00,"It may be hard to answer this question because you don't know what that is, but do you have any thoughts on that?",492.833,497.0
SPEAKER_00," If you were really sick, if we were to try just a mask, and we would do it just as long as you were okay with it and comfortable at the time.",497.381,503.98
SPEAKER_01, Would it be for a long time?,504.808,505.96
SPEAKER_00, Not usually.,506.422,507.104
SPEAKER_00,"Most times with BiPAP, it's only about two to six hours for most patients.",507.165,510.94
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that would be okay with me.",511.364,512.818
SPEAKER_00," Okay, and if we had to put large IVs and lines into your wrist and stuff and take you to the intensive care unit, again, we wouldn't do breathing tube, but this is just to watch you closely?",513.0,523.259
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I would be okay with that.",525.303,527.468
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, yes.",527.748,528.55
SPEAKER_01,It doesn't sound invasive to me.,529.412,532.038
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so let me just summarize.",533.1,534.844
SPEAKER_00,"I mean, it sounds like before you came into hospital, you know, life was pretty good.",535.285,538.693
SPEAKER_00,"I mean, it sounds like you've had some rough times with the heart failure.",538.713,541.599
SPEAKER_00, We're very clear we do not want to put the breathing tube down.,542.704,545.337
SPEAKER_01,Absolutely.,545.578,546.0
SPEAKER_00," But we're okay with medicines, we're okay with a mask, we wouldn't restart your heart.",546.04,551.054
SPEAKER_00," I think that's pretty much everything I think I needed to hear, but is there anything else that you wanted to cover or talk about that I've missed?",553.501,560.779
SPEAKER_01," No, I just needed to be reassured that it won't happen again.",561.361,566.488
SPEAKER_01,"And yeah, I know that on my chart, it's there.",568.912,574.0
SPEAKER_00," Yes, yes.",574.442,575.145
SPEAKER_01,And that's all I need to hear because I was concerned.,575.586,578.9
SPEAKER_00," Okay, I do want to say that this is not set in stone in the sense that if you ever change your mind, we can have the conversation again.",579.06,588.0
SPEAKER_00," But if we don't hear from you, this is what we'll go with.",588.561,591.748
SPEAKER_00,"No breathing tube, no restarting the heart.",592.169,594.334
SPEAKER_00,I just want you to know that in case anything were to change.,594.374,596.739
SPEAKER_01," Okay, so if I change my mind, I can, I will talk to you.",597.301,601.172
SPEAKER_00,Absolutely.,601.393,601.934
SPEAKER_01,I don't think I'll change my mind.,602.536,603.779
SPEAKER_00," I don't think you will either, but it's just nice to, so that you're aware of that.",604.0,607.916
SPEAKER_01,Okay.,608.056,608.398
SPEAKER_00," Honestly, I mean, there's some other questions I tend to ask people when I don't know them well, just kind of routine stuff.",609.381,614.478
SPEAKER_01,Okay.,614.699,614.94
SPEAKER_00, And maybe we'll just quickly go through it.,615.321,616.866
SPEAKER_01,Go ahead.,617.067,617.368
SPEAKER_00,"Your medical history is the heart failure, anything else?",617.388,619.535
SPEAKER_01, That's it.,621.561,622.023
SPEAKER_01,"I'm beginning with an S, but I can't remember what it is.",622.043,626.213
SPEAKER_00,"Okay, that's okay.",626.393,627.155
SPEAKER_00,"We can, usually we have it written down.",627.195,628.619
SPEAKER_00," Your medications, I think I saw, you're on aspirin and digoxin, I think two others.",629.181,634.576
SPEAKER_00,Do you happen to know or have them written down?,634.616,635.96
SPEAKER_01," You know what, I always carry this paper with me, because I can't remember the names.",636.221,640.692
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,640.972,641.333
SPEAKER_00,"Oh, so you are on the water pill, the furosemide.",641.454,643.659
SPEAKER_01," Oh, okay.",644.461,644.842
SPEAKER_00,Yes.,644.923,645.123
SPEAKER_00,And then those high some.,645.404,646.347
SPEAKER_01,"Okay, great.",646.467,647.089
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,647.129,648.152
SPEAKER_00,Any allergies?,648.874,649.476
SPEAKER_01,No.,650.077,650.218
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,650.539,650.759
SPEAKER_00," And I won't ask about anything that runs in your family, given your age.",651.401,655.693
SPEAKER_00,"They told me you're 70, is that correct?",655.734,656.897
SPEAKER_01,"That is correct, yes.",656.917,657.639
SPEAKER_00," And I do have to ask the following questions, completely unrelated to what we're talking about.",658.983,662.475
SPEAKER_01,That's okay.,662.635,663.157
SPEAKER_00,Do you smoke at all?,663.197,663.679
SPEAKER_01,"No, I don't.",663.699,663.92
SPEAKER_00, Do you drink any alcohol?,664.501,665.904
SPEAKER_01,No.,666.746,666.866
SPEAKER_00,No.,667.388,667.488
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,667.768,667.989
SPEAKER_00,"And this will sound crazy, but I have to ask, any street drugs, illegal drugs, anything like that?",668.43,673.0
SPEAKER_01," No, I never had the opportunity.",673.702,676.108
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,676.228,676.388
SPEAKER_00,And I don't want to ask.,677.07,678.273
SPEAKER_00,Any over-the-counter herbals in addition to these?,679.216,681.0
SPEAKER_01," No, I don't take any of those.",682.063,683.947
SPEAKER_00,And where are you living right now?,684.569,686.113
SPEAKER_01,I'm living in a convalescent home for the last six months.,686.855,689.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,689.521,690.583
SPEAKER_01,"I used to live in my own home, and six months ago I moved to a convalescent home.",690.603,698.88
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,698.9,699.0
SPEAKER_00," And how do you feel about that, with that change six months ago?",700.16,702.824
SPEAKER_01,I would really prefer my own home.,704.467,706.31
SPEAKER_01,But just trouble with my breathing sometimes.,708.613,712.74
SPEAKER_00, Right.,713.0,713.2
SPEAKER_00,"So are you feeling better about being in that place now, their new home?",714.002,717.808
SPEAKER_01,It's okay.,720.332,721.234
SPEAKER_01,I really have to adjust.,722.336,724.98
SPEAKER_01," Like I say, if I had my druthers, I'd go back, but I guess I have to learn to adjust to this.",725.521,732.577
SPEAKER_00,Right.,732.697,732.918
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,732.938,733.018
SPEAKER_00, So I think I sort of have all the information I need to make sure that your wishes are respected.,735.964,740.854
SPEAKER_00,"Just one last time, anything else that you want to talk about today?",741.415,744.0
SPEAKER_01," Oh, you answered my question.",744.02,747.449
SPEAKER_01,I was so worried about this tube.,747.99,751.018
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,751.719,751.92
SPEAKER_00, All right.,752.543,753.206
SPEAKER_00,"Well, it was very nice to meet you, Mr. Tillman.",753.226,754.553
SPEAKER_01,Thank you.,754.975,755.377
SPEAKER_00,See you.,755.397,755.558
