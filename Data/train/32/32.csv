SPEAKER_00,15.637,18.52," Okay, I want to switch gears again."
SPEAKER_00,18.7,25.496," I want to talk about risk, like suicide or harming others."
SPEAKER_00,27.38,32.316," I know all these things don't apply to everybody, but I want to make sure I go through and ask  certain questions."
SPEAKER_00,32.704,33.173, Is that okay?
SPEAKER_01,33.561,33.806, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,35.667,37.257, Have you ever had a suicide attempt?
SPEAKER_01,38.27,38.352, No.
SPEAKER_00,39.678,39.719, No?
SPEAKER_01,39.801,39.882, No.
SPEAKER_01,40.76,41.474, It's a sin to kill yourself.
SPEAKER_01,42.082,44.7," Only God can take your soul away, so that's..."
SPEAKER_01,45.425,46.25," No, you can't do that."
SPEAKER_00,47.68,48.231, So no attempts.
SPEAKER_00,48.68,50.639, Have you ever had thoughts of suicide?
SPEAKER_01,51.483,59.0," I mean, sometimes when I get really sad, I think that the world would be better without  me, but I bring myself out of that."
SPEAKER_01,59.342,61.297," I don't think it's anything I'd ever do, but..."
SPEAKER_00,62.784,67.48," Not something you ever do, but sometimes a thought crosses your mind like that."
SPEAKER_01,67.642,67.805, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,68.56,70.388, Do you remember the last time a thought like that crossed your mind?
SPEAKER_01,73.16,79.52, We were getting evicted from our last place because I just felt like a complete failure.
SPEAKER_00,80.085,80.813, How long ago was that?
SPEAKER_01,81.681,83.913, That was about a month and a half ago.
SPEAKER_01,85.7,90.335," Yeah, all my friends in the house turned against me because I couldn't pay rent."
SPEAKER_01,92.0,96.244," And it had been like the third month, but not consecutively, so I didn't see the big  issue."
SPEAKER_01,98.924,101.614," And so they told me that if I didn't get out, they would call the police."
SPEAKER_01,103.543,105.476," And I had to stay with my sister, and then I just..."
SPEAKER_01,106.202,107.059, I felt like a failure.
SPEAKER_01,107.14,109.009," I felt like a failure to myself, to my kids."
SPEAKER_00,111.56,112.509, So it's a tough time for you.
SPEAKER_01,113.601,114.111, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,115.144,115.634, So you had some...
SPEAKER_00,116.506,117.839, It sounds like maybe passing thoughts.
SPEAKER_01,117.981,118.879, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,119.161,121.191," But like I said, it's nothing I could ever do."
SPEAKER_01,122.981,123.185, Ever.
SPEAKER_00,124.524,126.094," If that ever changes, would you tell me?"
SPEAKER_01,127.002,127.267, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,128.022,128.798, I'll tell you.
SPEAKER_00,129.451,129.818, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,130.786,132.658, So how about harm to others?
SPEAKER_00,133.083,133.491, Meaning...
SPEAKER_00,136.181,142.022, Do you ever feel like you have thoughts or do you ever develop a plan to hurt someone  else?
SPEAKER_01,145.052,146.179," When I was younger, not anymore."
SPEAKER_00,146.886,147.674, When was the last time?
SPEAKER_01,149.085,150.696, Probably when I was in high school.
SPEAKER_00,151.607,152.158, So a while back.
SPEAKER_01,152.46,158.756," Yeah, when I was still in that violent stage in my life, where I would fight."
SPEAKER_01,160.743,163.779," But I never went to anything like, I'll kill this person."
SPEAKER_01,163.88,167.014," It was always just, I'll knock you out, but I won't kill you."
SPEAKER_00,168.623,169.411, That was a while ago.
SPEAKER_00,170.28,172.28," Presently, no thoughts of harming anybody else."
SPEAKER_01,172.64,172.701, No.
SPEAKER_01,173.74,177.114," If I ever feel really, really angry, I just gonna punch a wall."
SPEAKER_01,178.74,181.749, I have special plates that I'll throw on the ground and break them.
SPEAKER_00,185.861,187.311, Like the suicidal thoughts.
SPEAKER_00,189.283,192.6," If thoughts of harming others do come up, would you tell me about those?"
SPEAKER_01,192.946,193.456, Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_01,193.64,196.313," I don't want to go to jail over hurting somebody, so I'd tell you."
SPEAKER_00,197.66,197.923, Thank you.
SPEAKER_00,200.181,205.636, Have you ever heard or seen anything that other people have not heard or seen?
SPEAKER_01,207.02,207.143, No.
SPEAKER_00,208.082,209.0, Never?
SPEAKER_00,210.407,211.955, How about under the influence of drugs?
SPEAKER_01,216.488,224.698," Well, when I used to do cocaine, sometimes I would like think that somebody's at the  door and they're not at the door, like nobody's there."
SPEAKER_01,225.661,227.688, I think somebody's in the house when there's nobody in the house.
SPEAKER_00,231.481,232.875, But not under the effect of drugs.
SPEAKER_00,233.36,233.85, It never happened.
SPEAKER_01,234.442,234.931, No.
SPEAKER_00,239.748,240.238, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,244.38,245.34, All right.
SPEAKER_00,245.682,247.534," So, I want to switch gears again."
SPEAKER_00,248.82,255.72," I want to talk about, if you're okay with this, the goals for counseling."
SPEAKER_01,256.21,256.455, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,256.72,264.098," So the goals that you want to meet by spending this time with me, you know, with treatment."
SPEAKER_00,264.962,267.499," And your general goals, like your goals in life."
SPEAKER_01,268.189,268.414, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,268.941,272.418," So, let's start with, if you're okay, your goals in life in general."
SPEAKER_01,273.774,273.958, Hmm.
SPEAKER_01,275.644,285.979," Because I haven't really thought much about it, but I would like to just have a real,  I mean, I don't care what the job is, just a nice cushy job."
SPEAKER_00,287.232,287.939, A better job?
SPEAKER_01,288.181,292.06," Yeah, where I can just relax, you know, my kids will have a good future."
SPEAKER_01,293.006,293.993, I'll have a good future.
SPEAKER_00,295.906,297.013, A better future for your children?
SPEAKER_01,298.08,298.504," Oh, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,301.87,303.42, Any other general life goals?
SPEAKER_01,304.915,305.44, I guess be drug free.
SPEAKER_01,306.986,309.797," Like I said, I'd really like to quit, but it's hard."
SPEAKER_00,313.032,313.318, All right.
SPEAKER_00,313.44,317.4, How about goals specifically for counseling?
SPEAKER_00,317.864,319.359, Like what you hope to get out of this counseling?
SPEAKER_01,320.064,322.219, I'd like to learn to be less angry.
SPEAKER_00,322.583,322.767, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01,323.44,324.87, And bring my blood pressure down a little bit.
SPEAKER_01,326.802,327.125," Um, sleep more."
SPEAKER_00,330.514,330.8, More sleep?
SPEAKER_01,331.82,332.127, Eat less.
SPEAKER_01,337.505,339.538," I don't know, I guess try to quit."
SPEAKER_01,340.891,341.416, Try to quit drugs.
SPEAKER_00,342.208,342.718, Quitting drugs?
SPEAKER_01,342.943,343.269, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,347.142,350.378, How confident right now are you that you can meet these goals?
SPEAKER_00,351.626,352.854, Specifically the counseling goals?
SPEAKER_01,357.391,359.719," Like, kind of, I guess, is that an answer?"
SPEAKER_00,360.425,360.854, It's an answer.
SPEAKER_01,361.425,361.772, Kind of.
SPEAKER_00,362.16,362.65, Kind of confident.
SPEAKER_01,363.2,380.487," Yeah, I mean, like I said, I haven't really moved forward anywhere every time I go to  a counseling place, so I mean, I'm willing to give it another shot, but because of my  history with it, it didn't really go anywhere in the first place, but I'm willing to try  again."
SPEAKER_00,381.781,385.938," Alright, so you're kind of confident and willing to try again."
SPEAKER_01,387.051,387.173, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,388.377,388.52, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,389.203,393.44," So, throughout this intake, I've asked you a lot of questions."
SPEAKER_00,394.486,396.5, I want to thank you for answering them.
SPEAKER_00,396.884,397.914, Do you have any questions for me?
SPEAKER_01,399.348,400.035," No, not really."
SPEAKER_00,401.801,405.596," So next time I see you, sorry, with you it would be about a week."
SPEAKER_01,406.724,406.989, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,407.88,410.296, I'm going to start with the actual counseling sessions.
SPEAKER_00,411.221,414.756," So, I'll still have some questions, but not as many as I've asked today."
SPEAKER_01,415.88,415.982, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,417.584,420.136," Does that make sense, how it's structured?"
SPEAKER_01,421.492,421.737, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,421.88,424.357," Alright, so we've completed intake."
SPEAKER_00,425.362,429.739," I'll still have some more questions, but we'll get to the counseling sessions."
SPEAKER_00,430.462,437.671, Next week we'll get started working on specific details of what's happened to you and what  might be causing it and how you can treat it.
SPEAKER_01,439.428,439.673, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,440.673,440.979, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,441.04,445.754," So, I appreciate again you taking this time and answering these questions and I'll see  you next week."
SPEAKER_01,446.04,446.979," Alright, thank you."
SPEAKER_00,447.04,447.332, Thanks Rhonda.
