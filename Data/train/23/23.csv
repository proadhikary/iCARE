SPEAKER_00,14.218,15.24," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."
SPEAKER_00,15.681,17.234, I hope you find this video useful.
SPEAKER_00,17.96,20.956," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_00,21.76,23.145," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,27.52,31.076," So, alright, let's take a step back and talk about competency."
SPEAKER_00,31.98,36.078, What education did you need for the job you have now?
SPEAKER_01,36.54,39.897," I have my bachelor's degree, and we got a little bit of training."
SPEAKER_01,40.52,43.335," You know, every so often we get some training at work and stuff like that."
SPEAKER_00,44.18,49.08, Are you evaluated at work by anybody to see if you're doing the job you should be?
SPEAKER_01,49.28,57.33," Yeah, I have a supervisor, so they check up on stuff, and also if I feel like I have questions  and stuff like that, I can go to them as well."
SPEAKER_00,59.36,71.64," Have you been found in that system to be somebody who's satisfying the requirements of, in terms  of competency, satisfying the requirements of an employee?"
SPEAKER_01,72.223,75.5," Yeah, I mean, I haven't been fired, so that's a good sign, I guess."
SPEAKER_00,75.56,76.207, That's a good sign.
SPEAKER_00,78.356,78.52, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,78.54,80.3, You haven't been fired.
SPEAKER_00,80.3,86.458, Have you ever had any type of write-up or somebody discussing something with you?
SPEAKER_01,87.241,95.577," No, I just kind of feel like maybe the climate has changed a little bit at the office after  this happened, like maybe other people think I didn't make the right decision."
SPEAKER_01,96.16,112.459," I guess maybe that's part of where all my doubts are coming from, like no one has said  to me, and I haven't, you know, my supervisor hasn't called me in and said, I'm concerned  about this, but I just feel like maybe other people think that I did something wrong."
SPEAKER_00,114.403,131.459," All right, so there's no evidence supporting that in a kind of a direct fashion, like a  supervisor coming to you, but there's other evidence supporting it based on what you're  feeling and how you're maybe perceiving things."
SPEAKER_01,131.764,131.988, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,132.6,138.47," And you're getting this feeling that by the way they're interacting with you, by the way  they're relating to you, that..."
SPEAKER_01,139.421,164.495," Yeah, which I guess maybe I shouldn't be that freaked out about because there have been  other people who have made mistakes and like the supervisors have talked to them and, you  know, even then they didn't lose their job, so it's not like, you know, I have, you know,  I don't know, I guess it's not like just hearing them or thinking that they're judging me is  an indication that something terrible is going to happen or that I made this huge mistake."
SPEAKER_00,167.764,184.26," All right, so you can see that, from talking this through, you can see that some of this  could be feelings, thoughts you're having combined with what you're actually observing."
SPEAKER_01,184.461,184.726, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,185.46,196.14," And it's not like you're filtering your observations in a way that's maybe making them seem a little  more destructive, a little more negative."
SPEAKER_01,196.682,221.291," Yeah, it's kind of like I know it's not that big of a deal because, like I said, my supervisor  hasn't talked to me and it's not like I've heard anything terrible about anything happening  to the kids or anything like that, but I just feel like, you know, I have those thoughts  like oh, was she, you know, saying something, you know, when she said that, was she referring  to what happened and stuff like that."
SPEAKER_00,223.38,234.356, Can you provide an example of an interaction with a coworker where they said something  that you thought maybe was referring back to this?
SPEAKER_01,235.721,273.619," Yeah, so like we were having like a regular work meeting and we kind of like, you know,  discussed how things are going and it's been kind of a big deal, you know, more so than  usual because the kids were removed from this family, so, you know, one of my coworkers  kind of nudged me and said like, oh, you're the bulldozer, you know, you plowed right  through that family and took those kids away and, you know, I think she meant it kind of  like as a joke and just, you know, maybe to say like, you know, you did what you needed  to do, but it kind of made me feel like, does she think that I'm just callous?"
SPEAKER_01,273.8,278.635," Like does she think that I just didn't care and, you know, you get what I'm saying?"
SPEAKER_00,280.28,296.6," Yeah, yeah, so she referred to you as a bulldozer and one way to take that would be powerful,  efficient, but another way to take that would be kind of destructive."
SPEAKER_00,296.68,302.31," We talked about before, destructive, callous, they're mechanical, they don't have a lot  of feeling."
SPEAKER_01,302.8,302.943, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,304.362,309.38," So, you don't know exactly how she meant it, but you're thinking maybe it was connected"
SPEAKER_00,309.482,309.788, that way.
SPEAKER_01,310.4,324.779," Yeah, and I guess it kind of like, it goes back to like my fear that I didn't think it  through, that I kind of just, you know, I made the report and that was that and, you  know, it makes me feel like, was I being mechanical?"
SPEAKER_01,325.04,329.519," Did I just, was I just nonchalant about it?"
SPEAKER_01,329.68,331.197, Should I have put more thought into it?
SPEAKER_01,331.52,334.331," And it really, you know, it hit me where it hurt, I guess, you know."
SPEAKER_00,336.48,349.158," So her saying that really kind of brought up this thought that maybe you are, maybe  you are not empathetic enough or compassionate enough."
SPEAKER_01,350.103,352.837," Yeah, or even just thoughtful."
SPEAKER_01,353.42,360.876," I guess maybe I was just being, you know, just going about my job without putting a  lot of thought into what I was doing."
SPEAKER_00,361.321,361.77, It's automatic.
SPEAKER_01,362.28,362.643," Which is, exactly."
SPEAKER_00,365.1,373.656," So maybe one thing you would have done differently in light of that comment, at the time make  a decision you would have thought through the steps more?"
SPEAKER_01,374.963,377.353," Yeah, maybe taken a little bit more time."
SPEAKER_01,379.28,381.715," But at the same time, I mean, I don't have a ton of time."
SPEAKER_01,382.541,383.718, I've been good at my job.
SPEAKER_01,383.94,390.313," I've been doing things that way, but then it just kind of made me think, have I been  missing stuff all along?"
SPEAKER_01,391.262,391.575, I don't know.
