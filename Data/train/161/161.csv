SPEAKER_00," Hi Jesse, how are you doing today?",14.696,15.717
SPEAKER_01," Not too good, Dr. Grande.",18.04,19.02
SPEAKER_00, Not so good?,19.632,20.04
SPEAKER_01," No, I just got into a fight with my parents.",20.381,23.735
SPEAKER_00, What's been going on?,25.08,25.584
SPEAKER_01, I've been doing heroin for a few months now.,28.261,34.436
SPEAKER_01," I didn't think my parents knew, but I guess they found a needle in my room.",36.501,42.353
SPEAKER_01, They knew what I was doing.,46.04,46.946
SPEAKER_01, They told me that I have to start shaping up and I need to stop doing any kind of drugs.,49.602,56.02
SPEAKER_01," They said the next time they find any kind of drugs, that's it.",57.163,63.96
SPEAKER_01, They're going to kick me out of the house.,64.484,65.899
SPEAKER_00, So they're at the point where anything else happens and they discover it and you're out on the street.,66.842,73.04
SPEAKER_01, Right.,73.101,73.282
SPEAKER_00, What are your feelings about being out on the street?,76.168,77.798
SPEAKER_01, I don't want to be out there.,79.022,80.786
SPEAKER_01,I don't know who would be.,80.906,82.049
SPEAKER_01, It would be hard just to stop cold turkey.,87.201,90.437
SPEAKER_01, I know a couple of buddies that did that and it's not good when you get junk sick.,91.04,96.233
SPEAKER_01," I'm kind of stuck because I don't want to be out on the streets, but it's just going to be so hard to give it up.",99.1,106.739
SPEAKER_00, There are conflicting feelings here.,107.322,108.832
SPEAKER_00," You don't want to be out on the street, but you don't want to give up the heroin at the same time.",110.04,114.418
SPEAKER_01, Right.,115.101,115.383
SPEAKER_01," I just don't want to give it up, but I kind of know I have to.",122.29,127.038
SPEAKER_01, I'm a young guy.,128.08,128.983
SPEAKER_01,I couldn't make it outside of my parents' house and I definitely don't want to be out on the streets.,129.845,133.676
SPEAKER_00, You want to stop to avoid the consequences that could happen.,136.083,140.699
SPEAKER_01, Right.,141.323,141.565
SPEAKER_00, But to this point you haven't been able to?,143.482,145.352
SPEAKER_01, I guess at this point I really haven't had something that would make me.,147.642,154.078
SPEAKER_01," I've been doing it for a while and it's been pretty great, but I never really had any kind of problem with it.",155.2,165.9
SPEAKER_01," Nothing too bad has happened, so this is kind of the first time something has hit me where it's like, man, I really got to stop it.",166.321,175.04
SPEAKER_00, So this is the first consequence or potential consequence that's motivated you since you started using.,175.341,181.92
SPEAKER_01, Right.,182.444,182.707
SPEAKER_00, How strong is the craving to use?,184.261,186.331
SPEAKER_01," I mean, when I first started it was pretty freaking great.",188.321,194.659
SPEAKER_01," The rush that you get from it, it's just mind-numbing.",195.742,200.315
SPEAKER_01,It's just amazing.,200.516,201.98
SPEAKER_01, But I've noticed recently that the rush isn't as intense anymore and it's even kind of starting to backfire a little bit where I actually feel a little sick without using it.,202.921,219.66
SPEAKER_01," And that kind of scares me, but the crazy things are definitely still there.",220.461,224.575
SPEAKER_00," So when you try to cut back, have you tried to cut back?",226.642,230.257
SPEAKER_01," I have before, but there was no reason to, so I didn't try very hard.",232.143,237.539
SPEAKER_00," When you did try, did you have the feeling where you were getting sick?",238.342,241.02
SPEAKER_01," I did, yeah.",241.882,242.403
SPEAKER_01,"It wasn't as bad as any of my buddies, but I definitely didn't feel well.",242.984,247.675
SPEAKER_00," Have your parents given you any options in terms of, like, do they understand that it seems like you're a little dependent on...?",250.561,258.04
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I mean, they do.",258.681,260.064
SPEAKER_01,"I definitely, like, I don't hold anything against my parents.",260.125,264.093
SPEAKER_01,I actually have a pretty good relationship with them.,264.194,266.218
SPEAKER_01, I know what I'm doing isn't good for me.,267.762,269.968
SPEAKER_01,And they said that they would completely support me.,270.149,273.779
SPEAKER_01, They told me that they have a place picked out where I can go and that they'd be willing to pay for it and everything.,274.762,280.0
SPEAKER_01," But they said if I don't meet them halfway, then that's it.",280.14,286.915
SPEAKER_01,They're done.,287.236,287.777
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so they have a solution, in a sense, for what's going on.",289.241,294.255
SPEAKER_00,Is it like a detox?,294.837,295.799
SPEAKER_01," It is, yeah.",296.081,296.836
SPEAKER_00, So they have a solution to help get you off the heroin.,298.04,304.129
SPEAKER_00,But is there still a part of you that doesn't want to go that route?,306.632,311.74
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I think I'm starting to come to terms that it's time to stop.",312.12,320.274
SPEAKER_01,And it might be good that maybe I'm stopping so early.,321.135,323.98
SPEAKER_01, I know my friends have been doing it for a lot longer than I have.,324.26,327.767
SPEAKER_01,"But I just, I don't know if the detox is going to work.",329.15,334.02
SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's hard for me to focus on, like, anything until, sometimes until I get my next fix.",334.361,343.759
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so there's a few problems here.",344.702,346.448
SPEAKER_00,So one is can you commit to going to detox?,346.488,350.04
SPEAKER_00," And the second is, even if you successfully complete that, when you come back out, you can be able to avoid the heroin.",351.002,358.82
SPEAKER_01, Right.,359.16,359.481
SPEAKER_01,It's tough right now because actually my dealer lives in my neighborhood.,360.483,365.191
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, he's just a few houses down.",365.251,369.98
SPEAKER_01, My girlfriend lives in our community too.,372.181,375.385
SPEAKER_01,"And, like, he's on the way to her house.",375.606,378.91
SPEAKER_01,"So, like, I'll kind of just maybe pick it up on my way and throw it in my book bag and then get hanging out with my girlfriend a bit.",378.95,386.92
SPEAKER_01, And then maybe on my way back home I'll shoot up the buddy.,387.181,391.217
SPEAKER_00, Right.,394.023,394.685
SPEAKER_00,"So, really, you're running into him as you walk to your girlfriend's house.",394.966,399.699
SPEAKER_01, Right.,400.591,400.918
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,400.938,401.02
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, and he's there and the temptation is great.",401.462,404.799
SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's, like, that house is kind of, that's actually where I shoot up a lot.",407.983,413.178
SPEAKER_01,So it's like whenever I'm...,413.238,414.04
SPEAKER_01, I was in his house.,414.06,415.02
SPEAKER_00, Right.,415.38,415.621
SPEAKER_01,Right.,415.761,416.061
SPEAKER_01,"So it's like whenever I'm coming up to his house, I'm like, I start getting excited, you know, like, I start anticipating how great it's going to feel the next time.",416.122,429.04
SPEAKER_01," And it's, I don't know, it's like stuck with me.",429.422,432.474
SPEAKER_01,I get excited when I see his house.,432.574,434.0
SPEAKER_00, Right.,434.621,434.721
SPEAKER_00,So you have a feeling.,434.741,435.722
SPEAKER_00,"So, let's explore this.",436.383,437.344
SPEAKER_00,"So as you're walking up to the, well, as you're getting ready to pass his house, like, to point your way to your girlfriend, you divert to kind of go to his house and you have this feeling of excitement.",437.384,449.04
SPEAKER_00, What's the thought that's going through your mind?,449.946,451.617
SPEAKER_01," I, like, I kind of, I just can't wait for the next hit.",456.506,460.412
SPEAKER_01,"Now, like, I've passed his house since my parents had given me the ultimatum.",462.295,466.02
SPEAKER_01," And now it's kind of mixed because I'm like, oh, man, if I get to do that and somehow they find out, like, it's kind of all over for me.",467.303,475.98
SPEAKER_01," And then, but on the other hand, I'm thinking about how great it's going to be.",477.122,481.528
SPEAKER_01,"I'm just kind of like, I'm playing in my mind how much I'm going to do and like, what kind of plans we'll have for the rest of the night.",481.548,488.379
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,492.545,492.825
SPEAKER_00,So you have a few things going on.,493.025,497.331
SPEAKER_00,"Do you think, like, is your plan right now to go into the detox?",499.894,504.04
SPEAKER_01," It is, yeah.",504.981,506.123
SPEAKER_01,"It's, yeah, I mean, my definite plan is to go into the detox.",506.444,511.912
SPEAKER_01,"And if the detox works, like, I mean, I think I could be done with it.",512.012,517.0
SPEAKER_01," But it's just, I don't know if the detox can work.",518.442,522.469
SPEAKER_01,"And I mean, I've never, I only tried to cut back that one time.",522.529,525.514
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, I don't know how good I'll be at it, you know.",525.534,528.719
SPEAKER_00," Let's presume for a second that the detox would be successful and you wouldn't be, well, you mean you wouldn't be on heroin coming out of detox, right?",529.661,540.04
SPEAKER_01, Right.,540.367,540.571
SPEAKER_00, Are you worried at that point that you'll go right back?,542.585,546.599
SPEAKER_01, I don't know if I'll go right back.,548.601,550.085
SPEAKER_01,"Like, I think if I can get off it, if the detox actually works, like they say I do, I think I can stay off it.",550.305,556.479
SPEAKER_01," I think, like, my, I think my cravings will still always be there.",557.621,562.587
SPEAKER_01,"But now that it's, like, now that I've come to the realization that some of the stuff that I can lose if I get caught, I mean, if I can get off it for good, I don't, I don't think I'd go back.",563.428,574.0
SPEAKER_01," It might be hard, like, if I run into my buddy or something.",574.804,577.477
SPEAKER_00," That's the point of worry, right?",578.626,580.02
SPEAKER_00, Right.,580.04,580.244
SPEAKER_00," So there is a concern that you'll, you could, you could go back if you run into him.",581.201,585.879
SPEAKER_01, Right.,586.162,586.53
SPEAKER_00," But if you could stay away from him, you think you'd increase your chances of being successful?",587.1,592.0
SPEAKER_01," Well, I mean, yeah, definitely.",592.481,593.482
SPEAKER_01,"I won't, like, there's, there's so many, like, experiences in this house that, that kind of feed into the anticipation and the cravings.",593.542,603.917
SPEAKER_01,"So, I mean, if that doesn't happen, you know, it'll probably help.",603.977,606.02
SPEAKER_00, When are your plans in terms of going into detox?,607.487,609.537
SPEAKER_01, Pretty soon.,610.983,611.625
SPEAKER_01,I think I'm supposed to go on Monday after the weekend.,611.705,615.235
SPEAKER_01,"So, like, three days.",615.255,617.04
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,617.18,617.541
SPEAKER_00,"So it, it, it actually sounds like what your parents have put in place, you believe will work, right?",619.585,626.198
SPEAKER_00,You have confidence it'll work.,626.218,627.04
SPEAKER_00," And that your, your worry is, what worry you have is when you get out, can you avoid, can you avoid your friend?",627.1,636.04
SPEAKER_01, Right.,636.04,636.162
SPEAKER_00, You don't buy from anybody else other than your friend?,637.383,639.04
SPEAKER_01," No, no, no.",639.101,639.734
SPEAKER_00," So, so that's really becomes the, you know, maybe one of your key goals here since, since you're kind of, sound like you're committed to the detox part.",641.04,648.02
SPEAKER_01, Right.,648.203,648.346
SPEAKER_00," I mean, unless I'm, I'm reading that incorrectly, that, that seems to be something you're-  ",649.06,654.819
SPEAKER_01,"No, yeah, if it works, I mean, I can try.",,
SPEAKER_00," So it's, it's preparing for life after detox.",655.362,658.316
SPEAKER_01, Right.,659.101,659.244
SPEAKER_00," And avoiding, well, you've heard the phrase, people, places, things, with the, you know, addictions or, or substance use.",662.022,672.679
SPEAKER_00," So in this case, you need to avoid, it would seem, your friend.",673.201,676.96
SPEAKER_01, Right.,677.04,677.183
SPEAKER_00," And, and where he lives.",678.141,678.848
SPEAKER_00," Right, which is unfortunately not far from you and in between, like his house is in between your house and your girlfriend's.",680.16,690.04
SPEAKER_01, Right.,690.326,690.632
SPEAKER_00," Right, so, is there a way, this may seem a little odd, but is there a way to walk around the block where you can completely avoid his house and still get to your girlfriend's house?",691.1,699.92
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I mean, there is, it's kind of out of the way, but I think, yeah, I could go, there's like a, like a horseshoe path, I could, yeah, I could, I could like go up the block and then like around the horseshoe and then, and then I could like turn right and get to her house there.",701.32,716.02
SPEAKER_01," And then, yeah.",716.04,716.489
SPEAKER_00, So you would never even see his house.,717.06,718.04
SPEAKER_01, Right.,718.795,718.999
SPEAKER_01, Right.,719.305,719.571
SPEAKER_00," How about other options as well, like, so there's that option, how about her coming over to where your parents live, has that ever happened before?",720.401,726.519
SPEAKER_01," I mean, yeah, she's, she's come over, so maybe if like, maybe if I tell her that it'll, it'll help me out, she can, like she can make that walk and it'll be, like it'll be easier.",727.641,737.619
SPEAKER_00, Because she can walk right by that house without a problem.,738.04,739.535
SPEAKER_01," Right, right, and I mean, if I start walking out of the house, it'll be harder for me to actually do what I'm supposed to, so if I like can't even leave and she comes, that might be best.",740.1,748.82
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,749.489,749.754
SPEAKER_00," And to get to work, do you have to pass his house?",750.04,752.476
SPEAKER_01," No, not at all.",753.381,754.223
SPEAKER_01,"I, like I work down the road, so I just drive, like I drive the other way out the, out the community.",754.544,760.04
SPEAKER_00," Right, so there's kind of some, like really there's a physical kind of slash behavioral strategy here, which is just physically keeping you away.",760.06,769.04
SPEAKER_01, Right.,769.203,769.55
SPEAKER_00," From having to go buy his house and it sounds like the only reason other than to, to buy and use drugs is to see your girlfriend.",770.301,777.04
SPEAKER_01," Right, yeah.",777.04,778.04
SPEAKER_00," And there's an alternative strategy here, right?",778.2,779.805
SPEAKER_00,"She, she can come to you or you could go all the way, all the way around and then all the way around back.",779.825,784.699
SPEAKER_01, Right.,785.04,785.509
SPEAKER_00," To return it and to get back and forth to work, you don't have to go buy his house at all.",786.04,790.04
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, I could do that actually.",790.08,791.272
SPEAKER_01,I don't know where.,791.293,791.878
SPEAKER_00, Is there ever a time where he comes to you?,792.825,794.637
SPEAKER_01," Honestly, not that much.",796.421,797.743
SPEAKER_01,"Now, he, obviously he doesn't, he doesn't really like to leave his house much.",797.844,803.715
SPEAKER_01,"He's, he's kind of the only one who lives there.",804.156,805.96
SPEAKER_01," So that's kind of, he just deals out of there and then shoots up there, so he, he stays in his house most of the time, so now he doesn't even come out.",806.621,814.599
SPEAKER_00," And we, you know, we, we know that there's automatic thoughts, we talked about this before, right?",816.922,822.333
SPEAKER_00,There's automatic thoughts that lead to feelings and behaviors.,822.353,826.02
SPEAKER_01, Right.,826.203,826.489
SPEAKER_00, Right?,827.16,827.861
SPEAKER_00,And can you identify a specific thought that may occur or maybe has occurred not related to walking by his house but when you've been in your house?,828.722,842.0
SPEAKER_00," Like, that maybe has motivated you to go walk to his house?",843.121,845.778
SPEAKER_01, Right.,846.04,846.322
SPEAKER_01,I'm bored.,847.248,848.376
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,849.122,849.979
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, just straight up, I mean when, when there's nothing to do in the house, my parents are gone.",850.241,855.514
SPEAKER_01,"So it's a, it's the best way to have fun.",856.516,857.98
SPEAKER_00, Right.,858.14,858.381
SPEAKER_00,"So you've identified a thought that, that directly connects to a behavior you want to avoid, right?",859.063,864.02
SPEAKER_01, Right.,864.264,864.53
SPEAKER_00," So I'm bored leads to using the drugs, right?",866.04,870.693
SPEAKER_00,"Because that would alleviate the boredom, right?",870.713,873.02
SPEAKER_01, Right.,873.244,873.489
SPEAKER_00," Is there an adaptive response that you can put in right there that you can interject right at that moment when you say, I'm bored?",874.822,880.258
SPEAKER_00, Is there an adaptive response you can apply?,881.764,883.211
SPEAKER_00,"Let's assume this is post detox, right?",883.231,884.919
SPEAKER_01, Right.,885.101,885.346
SPEAKER_00," Okay, that's your plan.",886.04,886.581
SPEAKER_00,"You're sitting in your house, detox is done.",887.203,889.107
SPEAKER_00,"There's no more, you know, we would hope withdrawal type symptoms.",891.612,894.779
SPEAKER_01, Right.,895.04,895.162
SPEAKER_00," The thought comes upon you, I'm bored.",896.12,897.905
SPEAKER_00,"What's a, what's a self-talk piece that could be interjected there?",899.85,903.699
SPEAKER_01," I think like if I, if I remember to think what I don't want to do when I think that I'm bored, like I just kind of come up with something else.",907.465,916.699
SPEAKER_01," So like right now my, usually my two choices when I'm bored are either to go to my buddy's house or go to my girl's house who's, you know, across from my buddy's.",917.24,926.04
SPEAKER_01," So maybe that could just be like one of the times where I call my girl and be like, hey, can you just like come over, we can do something.",926.04,932.92
SPEAKER_01," Like just to kind of distract me from, from like wanting to go over to his place, you know.",933.04,938.94
SPEAKER_00," So, so the, the adaptive response is I'll call my girlfriend.",939.883,944.0
SPEAKER_01," Right, yeah.",944.183,945.04
SPEAKER_00," So I'm bored and, and she, you know, it sounds like what you said, she's really supportive of you quitting.",945.241,952.86
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I mean she wasn't too happy with me doing it.",953.561,956.929
SPEAKER_01,"She doesn't use, so I mean there's, there's that.",956.969,959.514
SPEAKER_01,"So she'll be all, she'll be all on board for that.",959.615,961.96
SPEAKER_00," It seems like consequences motivate you, right?",962.642,964.709
SPEAKER_00,"I mean that's what brought you in today, like to talk about this anyway.",964.729,967.92
SPEAKER_00," So I'm wondering if another adaptive response, response couldn't involve, you know, I don't want any, any trouble.",968.622,975.04
SPEAKER_00," You know, and you can substitute a lot of words in for trouble.",975.521,978.509
SPEAKER_00,"There's all kinds of trouble that can occur from use and error, right?",978.529,983.04
SPEAKER_00, Right.,983.081,983.203
SPEAKER_00," So getting kicked out of your house, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to get kicked out of my house.",984.561,988.347
SPEAKER_00,"I'm clean and there's something else I can do here other than drugs, right?",989.408,996.539
SPEAKER_00, Like I'm thinking in times when your girlfriend might not be around.,997.06,1000.02
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1000.632,1000.836
SPEAKER_00," Right, so you still want to have, you want to have an adaptive response that's not necessarily tied to a person in case she isn't around.",1001.14,1007.04
SPEAKER_01, Right.,1007.469,1007.673
SPEAKER_00," So you can use that one, certainly, and that's a good one.",1008.04,1009.302
SPEAKER_00,"But when she's not around and you kind of revisit those consequences in your adaptive response, do you think that's going to be enough motivation to keep you from going to the house?",1009.683,1019.619
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I do.",1022.243,1023.005
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, I, like as of right now, work's going good, like school is going good.",1023.746,1029.955
SPEAKER_01,"I don't, like I really don't want any problems.",1030.156,1032.94
SPEAKER_01," And I think like now I'm starting to realize that if I, if I do keep using it's not just going to be something like that I do when I'm bored or like that I'm doing for fun.",1033.341,1042.88
SPEAKER_01, It's going to turn into like a problem that's going to kind of affect everything else.,1043.08,1048.766
SPEAKER_01,"So I think like if I just remember to tell myself, like when I'm feeling bored, if I just remember to tell myself like I don't, I don't want to be out in the streets and like especially I don't want to lose my job.",1049.327,1061.499
SPEAKER_01," Like I think telling myself those things, it'll help remind me like kind of what's at stake, you know.",1063.002,1069.138
SPEAKER_00," Good, good.",1070.862,1071.583
SPEAKER_00,So it sounds like you have some adaptive responses to use.,1071.623,1076.373
SPEAKER_00,Another thing that occurs to me is your parents around much?,1076.393,1079.379
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I mean they're, my dad works a lot, my mom's usually at home.",1080.862,1085.151
SPEAKER_01,"She works too, it's like a part-time job so she's usually like home at night.",1085.191,1088.88
SPEAKER_00, And is it at night one of the times when you have gone over to your friend's house?,1090.045,1092.96
SPEAKER_00," Well it's actually, it's more during the day.",1093.121,1094.616
SPEAKER_00, More during the day.,1095.04,1095.816
SPEAKER_00, So she could be an asset in terms of trying to stop you from leaving the house but only when she's there.,1096.662,1102.98
SPEAKER_01, Right.,1103.04,1103.183
SPEAKER_00," And similar to your father, you know.",1104.04,1105.382
SPEAKER_00,"So it's really, I guess we kind of narrow it down to when you're at home alone and particularly when your girlfriend's not available, that's your high-risk time.",1106.064,1115.04
SPEAKER_01," Right, yeah.",1115.04,1115.428
SPEAKER_00, So we have the cognitive adaptive responses to come in and play.,1117.142,1120.971
SPEAKER_00,But what if there's anything more behavioral we can do like can you go somewhere else?,1120.991,1124.84
SPEAKER_01, Well I think like one of the other things I do to kind of clear my head is I always go for a drive.,1125.621,1130.645
SPEAKER_01,"So like if I start feeling bored, I think maybe if I like get in my car and like I sat on the bus past his house, if I just drive away, like just physically leave the temptation.",1132.166,1146.94
SPEAKER_01, And then like from there I can go to a bookstore or like a comic book store.,1147.861,1153.066
SPEAKER_01,I could spend hours in there.,1153.206,1154.487
SPEAKER_01,"So maybe if I can like, I can remind myself to drive away, go to those stores and like maybe I can just kind of stay out there late enough until either like my girlfriend's home or my parents come home.",1155.188,1166.58
SPEAKER_00, I think that's a good plan.,1167.261,1169.246
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.,1169.727,1169.967
SPEAKER_00,"And remember that the more we apply these adaptive responses, right,  what we hope is that you, the risk decreases, like your craving decreases, your motivation to stay clean increases.",1170.549,1184.699
SPEAKER_01,Right.,1184.719,1185.02
SPEAKER_00," So while it may be a little inconvenient to drive someplace every time no one's available and you get that thought, that might not be something you have to do forever.",1185.621,1197.439
SPEAKER_01,Right.,1197.459,1198.04
SPEAKER_00, But that'll minimize the risk for now and we want to focus on the short term first and then we'll worry more about the mid-term and long-term.,1198.661,1208.559
SPEAKER_01,Right.,1208.719,1209.0
SPEAKER_00, Circumstances may change.,1210.823,1212.145
SPEAKER_00,Maybe people reside there forever.,1212.305,1215.57
SPEAKER_00,Maybe somebody's work schedule will change.,1217.333,1218.935
SPEAKER_00,Maybe there are other adaptations you can make.,1220.397,1221.92
SPEAKER_01,Right.,1221.94,1222.04
SPEAKER_00," But for now, I think this would be a good way to go, just keeping you away from the circumstance that you definitely don't want.",1223.082,1231.719
SPEAKER_01,Right.,1231.739,1232.04
SPEAKER_00, So good.,1233.162,1233.462
SPEAKER_00,There's a few behavioral pieces we have in here and then a few cognitive as well.,1233.482,1237.568
SPEAKER_00,So I want to see you in a couple of days before we go into detox so that we can practice some of these adaptive responses.,1239.03,1246.04
SPEAKER_00, I'd like you to practice them at home between now and then as well.,1246.501,1250.827
SPEAKER_00,Right?,1250.928,1251.168
SPEAKER_00,And these behavioral responses as well.,1251.548,1253.131
SPEAKER_00,But we'll try to get them shored up right before detox and I'll see it right after you come out as well.,1253.692,1258.72
SPEAKER_01,Okay.,1258.74,1258.98
SPEAKER_00, And we'll make sure that we just keep working on applying and refining these adaptive cognitive responses and these adaptive behavioral responses.,1259.501,1268.838
SPEAKER_01,Right.,1268.858,1268.998
SPEAKER_00,Does that sound like a plan?,1269.018,1270.04
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, definitely.",1270.721,1271.682
SPEAKER_01,"I think that will definitely help, especially being with your adaptive detox.",1271.702,1275.768
SPEAKER_01,That will definitely be the best.,1275.868,1277.591
SPEAKER_00,Right.,1278.572,1279.654
SPEAKER_00,"I appreciate you coming in, Jesse, and I'll see you in a couple of days.",1280.054,1282.658
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, thank you.",1282.678,1283.099
SPEAKER_01,Thank you.,1283.139,1283.499
SPEAKER_00,Thanks.,1283.7,1283.84
