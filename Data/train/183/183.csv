SPEAKER_00,7.515,9.599," Hello, my name is Dr. Todd Brondet."
SPEAKER_00,10.3,13.291, Welcome to part two in my series on clinical interviewing.
SPEAKER_00,15.901,17.315, This is a role play exercise.
SPEAKER_00,17.86,29.557," I'm here with Nell Kelly, a graduate assistant here at Wilmington University, and she'll  be role playing the same character, Anne, in part two and all the parts of these videos."
SPEAKER_00,30.72,41.429, So I want to remind you that this is just for educational purposes and your agency may  have different requirements when it comes to what needs to be included in a clinical  interview.
SPEAKER_00,42.141,52.777," And remember, all clients are individuals, so you may need to add or subtract different  elements to provide a ethical and appropriate clinical interview."
SPEAKER_00,53.76,57.784, So I'll turn it over to Nell to introduce some of the elements you'll be seeing in part  two.
SPEAKER_01,59.182,70.64," In this second section of the intake interview, Dr. Brondet will be eliciting information  about the client's childhood, relationship history, and spirituality."
SPEAKER_01,70.64,71.799, Let's get started.
SPEAKER_00,82.51,87.798," Okay, Anne, so I'm going to ask you some questions about your developmental history."
SPEAKER_00,88.92,96.688," Some of these you might have already answered during the screening, but it's important that  I capture them here as well."
SPEAKER_00,98.56,99.952, What city and state were you born in?
SPEAKER_01,100.98,101.96," Wilmington, Delaware."
SPEAKER_00,102.522,106.354," Okay, and how about what city and state were you raised in?"

SPEAKER_01,175.0,184.058," My mom was, she was kind of angry, an angry person."
SPEAKER_01,185.24,190.188," But it was, you know, my two sisters and me and my parents."
SPEAKER_01,197.16,198.368, We didn't want for anything.
SPEAKER_01,201.002,206.678, My parents loved us pretty much.
SPEAKER_01,210.168,213.639," And you know, we went to good schools."
SPEAKER_01,214.261,216.71," My mom, you know, my mom was pretty angry."
SPEAKER_01,219.36,222.89, Well at least towards me.
SPEAKER_00,226.36,227.289, Not so much toward you?
SPEAKER_01,228.523,228.687, No.
SPEAKER_01,230.503,236.396," I mean sometimes my sisters and my dad, she was like angry in general."
SPEAKER_01,238.241,239.594, I guess I got the most of it.
SPEAKER_01,240.3,253.17," I kind of think, I don't know, I was wondering if it was connected to my boss and the women  at work."
SPEAKER_01,253.941,255.249," I don't know, that's kind of why I'm here."
SPEAKER_01,257.28,262.936," And it happened in the neighborhood too, the women in the neighborhood after we moved  to this new neighborhood."
SPEAKER_01,263.12,266.616, And I'm really feeling like it's me and groups of women.
SPEAKER_01,268.143,271.738," And is there, I don't know, I don't know, you're the expert."
SPEAKER_01,272.38,275.012, But you asked me what my childhood was like.
SPEAKER_01,276.76,277.938, Like I can't complain.
SPEAKER_01,278.121,280.04, I wasn't like abused.
SPEAKER_01,280.481,290.948," Like I said, I was hit sometimes, but that was the way, I was hit more than my sisters  for sure, was the oldest."
SPEAKER_01,293.68,300.358," My sisters were, I was the oldest."
SPEAKER_01,301.08,304.3," My middle sister was, I don't know, do you want this?"

SPEAKER_01,329.36,339.851," She was the one, like, she'd wake up by herself several hours before school started and get  herself all ready, make herself breakfast, you know."
SPEAKER_01,342.463,343.97, And she was just always a good girl.
SPEAKER_01,345.98,353.316," And I mean, I wasn't a bad girl or anything, but I don't know."
SPEAKER_00,355.161,359.854," So the family dynamic you're speaking about, when did that change?"
SPEAKER_00,362.202,363.168, Or has it changed?

SPEAKER_01,389.209,389.495, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,390.841,398.849," We talked about this a little bit earlier, about how your experiences when you were young,  how were you disciplined as a child?"
SPEAKER_01,402.58,403.438," You know, yelling."
SPEAKER_01,403.902,405.674, My mom yelled a lot.
SPEAKER_01,408.922,421.669," And like I said, she didn't hold back from, you know, smacking my face or pulling my hair  or something like that."
SPEAKER_01,424.283,428.056," When I was younger, when I got older, she didn't do it as much."
SPEAKER_01,430.464,434.34," You know, I could kind of push her away."

SPEAKER_01,457.948,458.998, He was kind of quiet.
SPEAKER_00,459.924,462.738, He didn't get involved in the discipline component?
SPEAKER_01,463.96,466.493," No, I mean, that was Mom."
SPEAKER_00,475.613,475.96, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,475.98,479.417, I want to move on now to relationship history.
