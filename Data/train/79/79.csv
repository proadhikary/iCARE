SPEAKER_00,14.218,15.239," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."
SPEAKER_00,15.68,17.234, I hope you find this video useful.
SPEAKER_00,18.0,20.956," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_00,21.8,23.124," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,28.48,34.594," If we could, let's talk about the moment in the presentation again."
SPEAKER_00,37.36,43.053, I want to try to help you develop some strategies to bring those anxiety symptoms down.
SPEAKER_00,46.16,47.355, Let's actually go right before the moment.
SPEAKER_00,49.328,51.439, You're still sitting down and you're getting ready to present.
SPEAKER_00,51.6,53.872," Let's just say you're second to present, like we've talked about."
SPEAKER_00,55.42,61.776, They're thinking they're going to see me as anxious.
SPEAKER_00,63.62,64.744, They're going to think I don't belong here.
SPEAKER_00,69.58,80.048," These thoughts occur because you have an expectation, a rule, an attitude that you brought into  that class."
SPEAKER_00,81.965,85.179," When you walked into that class, you have these expectations already."
SPEAKER_00,85.46,86.338, It's perfectly natural.
SPEAKER_00,86.46,87.109, It's not right or wrong.
SPEAKER_00,87.94,88.846, Everyone has these beliefs.
SPEAKER_00,90.84,99.742," Whatever these beliefs are, and we'll talk about that at another point, they combine  with the stressor of having this presentation in front of you and the classmates watching  you."
SPEAKER_00,101.161,103.059, They result in these thoughts.
SPEAKER_00,103.14,104.508, We call them automatic thoughts.
SPEAKER_00,106.5,107.911," Just like the beliefs, they're not good or bad."
SPEAKER_00,108.98,110.815, They don't say anything about the person having them.
SPEAKER_00,111.46,112.517, They're just thoughts.
SPEAKER_00,113.543,116.312," Actually, they're fairly understandable and natural thoughts."
SPEAKER_00,118.72,122.69, The problem is that they lead to symptoms.
SPEAKER_00,126.7,132.176," You're sitting there at your desk and you're thinking, they're going to see that I'm anxious."
SPEAKER_00,133.54,135.671, They're going to realize I'm not good enough or think I'm not good enough.
SPEAKER_00,137.42,139.167, What reaction do you have when you have that thought?
SPEAKER_01,142.261,143.619, I guess I'm very observant.
SPEAKER_01,143.943,145.194, I start looking around.
SPEAKER_01,145.861,146.571, I'm sweating.
SPEAKER_01,147.28,149.799, I'm having physical responses.
SPEAKER_01,149.98,153.754," I'm looking around to see if anyone's already looking at me, like hypervigilance."
SPEAKER_00,156.098,156.2, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,156.26,157.231, Distressing symptoms.
SPEAKER_01,158.712,158.935, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,159.22,159.423, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,160.841,173.636, What's something that you could say to yourself in that moment that would maybe get in between  that thought and that reaction?
SPEAKER_00,174.42,179.084," That thought of, they're going to know I'm not good enough or think I'm not good enough  and that reaction."
SPEAKER_01,182.88,188.385," I think in that moment, most people are looking at the person who's presenting and not at  me."
SPEAKER_00,189.609,189.834, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,190.96,195.395, So that I could maybe take some deep breaths or try to calm myself down.
SPEAKER_01,197.12,204.244," Maybe look over my notes one more time because they're all watching the person who is presenting,  not me."
SPEAKER_00,206.738,206.86, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,207.08,219.952," So some deep breathing, looking over your notes, preparing yourself more, focusing on  that and realizing they're not really looking at you anyway at that moment."
SPEAKER_01,222.589,222.813, Right.
SPEAKER_00,223.916,224.14, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,224.16,224.262, Good.
SPEAKER_00,225.16,225.242, Good.
SPEAKER_00,226.14,226.926, You bring your notes with you to class?
SPEAKER_01,228.62,237.24," I mean, usually have index cards or maybe some stats on something that I want to look  over, like some numbers or something."
SPEAKER_01,237.26,237.947, I don't want to forget.
SPEAKER_00,239.75,239.893, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,240.26,241.219, So you always have those with you?
SPEAKER_01,241.26,241.913, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,242.32,246.999, It's a matter of can you focus your attention on them?
SPEAKER_01,247.423,247.709, Right.
SPEAKER_01,248.26,248.464, Exactly.
SPEAKER_00,249.648,250.24, Enough to not forget them.
SPEAKER_00,251.163,257.532," If you're focusing on that and you're thinking about that, you're not thinking about whatever  they might be thinking about."
SPEAKER_01,258.301,258.607, Right.
SPEAKER_01,259.444,259.709, Exactly.
SPEAKER_00,260.525,260.995, All right.
SPEAKER_00,261.26,263.54, How about the deep breathing?
SPEAKER_00,263.54,265.046, Is that a strategy you've tried before?
SPEAKER_01,268.3,277.63," A little bit, but with not much success because usually when I think to remember it, I'm in  panic mode and then it's really hard."
SPEAKER_00,279.821,282.238," So you've been able to do it sometimes, just not often?"
SPEAKER_01,282.542,283.378, Not consistently.
SPEAKER_00,283.46,283.48, All right.
