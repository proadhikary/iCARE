SPEAKER_00,14.218,15.24," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."
SPEAKER_00,15.681,17.234, I hope you find this video useful.
SPEAKER_00,17.96,20.956," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_00,21.76,23.145," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,27.56,48.461," So can you think of another case you're working on, another family different than the one  that we've initially talked about, where you've made a decision that seemed like it was fairly  clear cut, like one you would have made before, and yet you're thinking about it, replaying  it?"
SPEAKER_01,49.902,55.26," Yeah, I had this case recently where it's a single dad."
SPEAKER_01,55.32,69.736," The mom passed away, and I go in and check on him and his son, and things are going well,  but I think the dad has a hard time, so it's not like it was before when the mom was there."
SPEAKER_01,71.3,74.671," I wasn't there before that, but you can just tell that things are a little different."
SPEAKER_01,77.68,81.936, Obviously my decision is that things are going well for the kid.
SPEAKER_01,83.08,88.854," He's going to stay there, and dad is stable, but I just worry, like, is the dad under too  much stress?"
SPEAKER_01,89.16,96.639," Is he really taking care of the kid as good as, you know, what if he's just cleaning up  the house and doing the right things while I'm there?"
SPEAKER_01,96.84,101.355," While I'm not there, you know, does he have the energy to take care of his kid?"
SPEAKER_01,102.72,107.157," Is everything really the way it appears, or is there more going on?"
SPEAKER_01,108.101,108.807, I just don't know.
SPEAKER_00,113.026,123.719," All right, so you're handling it to the best of your ability, but there's still these thoughts  that are coming up, kind of encouraging you to second guess your judgment."
SPEAKER_01,124.001,125.713," Yeah, and it's like I can't let it go."
SPEAKER_01,126.801,130.719," I saw him two weeks ago, and I still wonder, and I have other cases like that."
SPEAKER_01,130.86,135.386," It's like they're all running through my head, and I have these thoughts like, did I do the  right thing?"
SPEAKER_01,136.88,137.868, Then I do the right thing.
SPEAKER_00,139.761,141.71, Maybe what if the worst happens?
SPEAKER_01,143.98,144.756, And I didn't see it.
SPEAKER_01,144.98,149.293," Like, what if something terrible happens, and I should have known better?"
SPEAKER_00,151.52,155.859, So it speaks back to your competency as a professional again.
SPEAKER_00,156.04,159.996, So that seems to be kind of core of this.
SPEAKER_00,161.1,172.115," A lot of things you, or several things you talk about seem to connect back to, are you  capable to be in this field, and should you be trusted?"
SPEAKER_01,174.143,175.529," Yeah, definitely."
SPEAKER_00,178.0,189.382," So on the, kind of moving back to thinking, there are errors in thinking that all people  make."
SPEAKER_00,192.441,205.073," And when these errors become repetitive, and you can kind of see them applied in more than  one area of somebody's life, we refer to that as a cognitive distortion."
SPEAKER_00,207.0,209.937," It's not bad or good, it's just how people think."
SPEAKER_00,210.38,212.21, It's just patterns that people fall into.
SPEAKER_00,215.24,226.358," And there are several different cognitive distortions, there are several patterns that  we kind of see come up often in this work, as a counselor."
SPEAKER_00,227.801,253.115," I'm wondering, in this situation where you're thinking the worst possible outcome is unbearable,  or likely, or both, if you may be really focusing and emphasizing on that to the exclusion  of other evidence that suggests you made a good decision."
SPEAKER_00,255.283,260.884," So you're really focused on the negative outcome, the worst possible, and maybe even unlikely  outcome."
SPEAKER_00,263.14,271.154," And maybe not weighing all the evidence with the same weight, like you're putting more  weight on the negative."
SPEAKER_01,271.562,271.869, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,272.46,273.216, Does that kind of make sense?
SPEAKER_01,273.621,286.059," Yeah, I mean, I think that that's probably true, because before I felt fine, and now  I just feel like everything's falling apart, and not that much has changed, and so it kind  of makes me think that that's probably what's going on."
SPEAKER_01,286.28,288.35, But I don't know how to change that.
SPEAKER_00,290.28,291.414, This is frustrating for you.
SPEAKER_00,292.704,294.595, This self-doubt and this worry.
