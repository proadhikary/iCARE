SPEAKER_00," Hi, Lucy.",0.02,0.16
SPEAKER_00, Nice to meet you.,20.16,20.814
SPEAKER_01, Hi.,21.08,21.223
SPEAKER_00, So I understand that you were referred here by your GP because you've been feeling quite  down recently.,22.08,27.953
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I thought I should.",28.481,29.432
SPEAKER_01, I've been feeling quite bad for quite a while.,30.161,32.24
SPEAKER_01, So I thought maybe it's time to see someone about it because I don't want to feel like this anymore.,32.421,37.359
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,37.884,38.298
SPEAKER_00," So from your notes, I saw that you saw the GP about three months ago.",38.561,43.079
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,43.441,43.626
SPEAKER_00, So how long have you been feeling down altogether?,44.221,46.578
SPEAKER_01," Quite a few months before that as well, actually.",47.484,49.999
SPEAKER_01, But it's gotten pretty bad these past few months.,50.16,53.738
SPEAKER_01, So that's kind of why I came.,54.241,55.493
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,56.405,56.739
SPEAKER_00, So has it got worse since you saw your GP?,56.881,59.079
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,59.16,59.385
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,60.265,60.43
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,60.76,60.846
SPEAKER_00," So tell me, how are things at the moment?",61.181,63.592
SPEAKER_01," Well, it kind of started just feeling a bit low and wound up about things.",65.32,69.86
SPEAKER_01," But I don't know, just recently I just can't really be bothered to do anything at all.",70.02,76.66
SPEAKER_01, I kind of find it hard to get motivated for things.,76.881,79.039
SPEAKER_01," And I want to be, I really want to be better, but it's just kind of reaching the end now where I  just want to do something about it.",79.2,88.395
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,89.304,89.6
SPEAKER_00," So you said that you're feeling really down, really sad.",89.781,93.259
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,93.603,93.789
SPEAKER_00, And you feel like you haven't got any motivation.,94.361,96.731
SPEAKER_00," But, are you okay?",98.781,100.437
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I'm fine.",100.823,101.48
SPEAKER_01, Sorry.,101.561,101.744
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,102.92,103.225
SPEAKER_00," And you haven't got any motivation, but it sounds like you put quite a lot of pressure on yourself to try and feel a bit better.",104.16,109.159
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,109.605,109.819
SPEAKER_01," I just, it's kind of hard as well because there's not really anyone to talk to about it.",109.92,114.04
SPEAKER_01," So I just kind of stay on my own trying to, I don't like to think about it, but I don't know.",114.16,121.838
SPEAKER_00," So you say you've been, you're feeling quite isolated.",122.721,125.52
SPEAKER_00, There's not many people around.,125.602,126.52
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, there's no one I can talk to about it.",126.56,129.098
SPEAKER_01, No one would listen or understand anyway.,129.541,131.175
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,131.763,132.04
SPEAKER_00, So I'm just going to try and find out a little bit more about you.,132.221,134.96
SPEAKER_00, So I understand that you're an English student at uni.,135.081,138.358
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,138.864,139.03
SPEAKER_00, And you live away from home with some friends.,139.541,142.36
SPEAKER_00, Is that right?,142.463,143.039
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,143.204,143.391
SPEAKER_01, I live here.,143.742,144.168
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,145.109,145.236
SPEAKER_00, So you don't live far from the uni.,145.461,146.932
SPEAKER_00," But you say you feel like you live with your friends, but you don't feel like you can talk to them.",148.2,151.599
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,151.845,152.157
SPEAKER_01," I mean, they're lovely.",152.402,153.8
SPEAKER_01," I get on really well with them, but I don't know.",154.744,158.06
SPEAKER_01," I just recently, whenever they want to go out or stuff, I just, I don't want to bring them down.",158.16,163.48
SPEAKER_01," I can't, they don't understand what I'm going through.",163.561,165.68
SPEAKER_01," They kind of, I don't know, they don't make fun of how I feel, but they don't really understand what it's like.",165.76,171.898
SPEAKER_01," I just, I don't want to go out with them and bring them down or stuff.",172.881,175.575
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,176.748,176.896
SPEAKER_00," So it sounds, do you try and hide the way you're feeling from them?",177.101,180.04
SPEAKER_01, I guess.,180.246,180.639
SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's easier to hide it than to try and explain it all the time when no one really wants to know.",180.78,187.297
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,188.787,189.08
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like you've been feeling down.,189.141,190.54
SPEAKER_00, You've been feeling unmotivated.,190.62,192.591
SPEAKER_00," You feel like you want to be better, but actually it sounds like you feel like you can't reach out for help.",194.301,198.52
SPEAKER_00, You can't speak to anybody.,198.621,200.198
SPEAKER_01, No.,200.565,200.749
SPEAKER_01, I don't really talk to my parents a lot either.,201.381,203.335
SPEAKER_01, So that's kind of hard.,204.282,205.393
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,206.247,206.518
SPEAKER_00, I'm just going to go back in time a little bit.,206.702,208.44
SPEAKER_00," I suppose I'm just wondering when, when did all of this start?",208.5,211.16
SPEAKER_00, You said it's been going on for quite a few months.,211.241,213.179
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,213.504,213.668
SPEAKER_01," Um, I guess it kind of started, uh, when I was actually, when I was revising for my exams, um, I guess the stress, I put a lot of stress on myself.",214.4,228.38
SPEAKER_01, I think I've always wanted to do well for me and I guess for my parents.,228.46,233.359
SPEAKER_01, So the stress of exams and it was also kind of hard because my parents were going through a bit of a troubled time then.,233.82,241.818
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,242.867,243.219
SPEAKER_00," So this would be like last March, last April?",243.381,246.259
SPEAKER_01," Uh, yeah, I think so.",246.622,248.498
SPEAKER_00, Around that time.,248.822,249.54
SPEAKER_00, So about six months-ish.,249.661,250.649
SPEAKER_00, And it sounds like a lot was happening.,252.222,254.1
SPEAKER_00," So you had a lot of uni pressure on and, um, and you said that your parents were having marital problems.",254.24,261.36
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,261.38,261.602
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,263.401,263.774
SPEAKER_00, And it sounds like that was a real shock to you.,264.101,267.057
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I guess it was hard as well because I wasn't doing well at uni.",267.66,272.4
SPEAKER_01, I guess I just felt a bit guilty.,273.689,275.098
SPEAKER_01," I know it sounds silly, but I felt like maybe if I could do better, then they would get better.",275.802,281.72
SPEAKER_01, But it just wasn't really happening.,281.821,284.516
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,285.354,285.44
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like you were trying to work hard and be more successful because you thought that that would make them happier and try and fix things.,285.48,293.94
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I wanted to make them feel better, but it just kind of backfired a little, I guess.",294.02,299.376
SPEAKER_00, How did it backfire?,300.681,301.59
SPEAKER_01, It just ended up with them getting worse and I've just been feeling worse since then.,302.7,307.575
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,309.221,309.56
SPEAKER_00," So after the summer, after the exam period, and how did that exam period go for you in the end?",309.7,315.578
SPEAKER_01, Not very well.,316.461,317.107
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,318.529,318.658
SPEAKER_00, That's an awful lot of pressure to put on yourself.,318.761,320.679
SPEAKER_00, I suppose to think...,321.044,322.319
SPEAKER_01, It's just annoying because I know I should have done better and I just didn't.,322.36,327.2
SPEAKER_01, And I guess I beat myself up a lot about it.,327.38,330.514
SPEAKER_00," So you say, I know, I know I should have done better.",332.041,334.652
SPEAKER_00," I mean, I suppose hearing it from my perspective, I'm thinking it sounds like you had an awful lot going on at the time.",336.64,342.1
SPEAKER_00," It'd be understandable, absolutely, that you wouldn't do as well as normal.",342.22,346.138
SPEAKER_00, I suppose I'm just wondering if you have very high standards for yourself.,346.74,349.632
SPEAKER_01, Probably maybe more than other people.,351.581,353.993
SPEAKER_01," My parents have always kind of taught me, not in a loving way, I guess, but that you should do your best, but also get the best.",355.4,364.24
SPEAKER_01, And I agree with that.,364.421,366.52
SPEAKER_01, I think that's the right thing to think.,366.822,368.334
SPEAKER_01," But when I don't do that, I don't know.",369.08,371.673
SPEAKER_01, It annoys me a lot and I worry that it annoys them.,373.121,375.894
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like you feel you should always do your best.,377.341,380.298
SPEAKER_00, Is that the word you used?,380.7,381.56
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,381.58,381.824
SPEAKER_00, And that there isn't any kind of exceptions for that?,383.08,384.995
SPEAKER_01, No.,385.803,385.905
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,386.741,387.085
SPEAKER_00, So I can see then that that was a really difficult time for you.,388.641,391.28
SPEAKER_00, And that was when your mood started to get lower and things are still quite bad now.,391.34,396.7
SPEAKER_00," I mean, what's the situation with your parents at the moment?",396.74,399.612
SPEAKER_01, I think it doesn't sound good.,401.761,404.74
SPEAKER_01," I don't really talk to them a lot, but I don't think they're going through very good.",404.82,409.439
SPEAKER_01, I don't like to talk to them about it because it just makes me feel worse.,409.66,413.476
SPEAKER_01, But I don't think it's getting any better.,414.481,416.273
SPEAKER_00, Were you home over the summer?,417.36,418.552
SPEAKER_01," For a little bit, yeah.",419.401,420.372
SPEAKER_00, And how was that?,421.141,421.766
SPEAKER_01, Not very fun.,423.401,424.088
SPEAKER_01, No.,425.401,425.543
SPEAKER_01, It was quite tense all the time.,427.221,428.611
SPEAKER_01," It stressed me out more than relaxed me over the summer, I guess.",429.9,433.173
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,435.021,435.446
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so it sounds then like quite a lot has been happening.",436.961,440.0
SPEAKER_00, You've been feeling very low.,440.041,441.08
SPEAKER_00, You've had uni pressure on.,441.08,442.935
SPEAKER_00, You've had problems with your parents' marriage.,443.681,446.34
SPEAKER_00," And it sounds like you feel like you can't really reach out to anyone,  like you can't understand, but you can't really reach out to your parents right now.",446.46,452.717
SPEAKER_00, You can't really confide in your friends.,453.3,455.353
SPEAKER_00," So I suppose I'm just wondering if you can tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling,  I mean, say this past week.",456.501,460.567
SPEAKER_01," Really not good, to be honest.",462.981,464.572
SPEAKER_01," I actually, if I don't have to, then I don't really leave the house or get out of.",465.76,472.02
SPEAKER_01," But I just, I can't find the motivation for the things I used to join.",472.1,476.22
SPEAKER_01," I used to love doing sports or going out, and now I just prefer to lie in bed and not really do anything.",476.4,482.358
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,483.244,483.659
SPEAKER_01," I missed a few lectures this week that I should have gone to, but...",483.76,486.395
SPEAKER_00, Right.,487.362,487.67
SPEAKER_00," So I suppose I'm just wondering then, let's see if we can think about one thing, say a lecture.",488.281,495.039
SPEAKER_00, What kind of thoughts do you have about going to that lecture before it happens?,495.781,498.976
SPEAKER_01, I don't really see the point anymore.,500.001,501.919
SPEAKER_01," If I can't do as well as I should be doing, then what's the point in putting myself in those positions?",502.18,510.177
SPEAKER_01," I just, I can't be bothered anymore to try.",511.641,515.06
SPEAKER_01, It just stresses me out more than I need to.,515.12,518.216
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so it sounds like the kind of thoughts you've got in your head are, it's pointless, it's not worth it.",519.04,524.899
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,525.264,525.451
SPEAKER_00, Do you have any other thoughts in your head when you're just at that point before you go to the lecture?,525.72,529.957
SPEAKER_01," I feel like, I don't know, I don't really even deserve to be here if I can't do well enough.",531.36,539.979
SPEAKER_01, I see all these other students who are doing well and doing better and want to be there.,540.4,544.672
SPEAKER_01," I don't know why I'm here even at uni, to be honest.",547.501,551.416
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like you feel like you're not as good as other people here.,552.441,555.56
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,555.662,555.825
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,556.801,557.226
SPEAKER_00," I'm just, sorry, is it okay if I take notes as we go through?",558.761,561.118
SPEAKER_00," It's just I'm trying to, I guess, understand what you're telling me and it helps me just to write it down  and I'll share this with you later.",561.4,567.228
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so it sounds like those are some quite negative thoughts to have.",569.521,573.02
SPEAKER_00," You're kind of saying, you know, it feels like it's pointless, it's more effort than it's worth,  and I don't deserve to be here.",573.16,579.596
SPEAKER_00," I mean, when you have those thoughts, how do you feel?",580.301,582.328
SPEAKER_01," Very unworthy probably would be the best way to put it, kind of, I don't know, lower than normal.",585.62,596.879
SPEAKER_01, Because then it makes me think about all the things that I should have been doing better.,597.8,601.758
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so what you described there then, you said, I'm unworthy, I should be doing lots of things better.",602.42,607.916
SPEAKER_00," Those are kind of what I would call thoughts, actually.",609.201,611.76
SPEAKER_00, I suppose I'm trying to understand what it feels like in your gut.,611.82,614.999
SPEAKER_00, What kind of emotions do you feel?,615.16,616.493
SPEAKER_00, Happier?,617.241,617.725
SPEAKER_00,Do you feel sad?,617.846,618.935
SPEAKER_00, What kind of emotions are you feeling when you have those thoughts?,619.58,622.292
SPEAKER_01, Sad.,624.221,624.545
SPEAKER_01, Not happiness.,625.7,626.65
SPEAKER_01," No, sad.",627.761,628.487
SPEAKER_01, A bit of anger and frustration as well.,630.302,632.035
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,632.8,633.103
SPEAKER_00," I know you're just kind of telling me this, and I know this is quite a heavy topic, but you're kind of laughing.",637.449,640.8
SPEAKER_00," And I suppose I wonder a little bit, are you a bit, you know, how do you feel about having these emotions,  talking about these emotions?",641.222,646.992
SPEAKER_01," I guess, embarrassed.",647.8,649.388
SPEAKER_01," I've never yet talked about it, so it's quite uncomfortable to be in this situation.",652.021,655.553
SPEAKER_00," Okay, well you're doing a great job, because I know that this can be difficult.",657.8,661.8
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so it sounds like some of the thoughts you're describing are, it's pointless, it's more than it's worth,  I don't deserve to be here, I'm unworthy.",661.8,670.353
SPEAKER_00," And those kind of thoughts, it sounds like they just flip through your mind.",671.8,675.217
SPEAKER_00, And then you're kind of describing different emotions that those lead to.,675.84,679.78
SPEAKER_00," You're kind of describing sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed.",679.82,682.78
SPEAKER_00," What about in your body, what happens?",682.8,684.35
SPEAKER_00," How do you feel, kind of physically?",685.901,687.109
SPEAKER_01," I used to be, I think from those emotions, very wound up, very kind of stressed all the time.",690.163,696.8
SPEAKER_01, But recently it's just been a lot more draining than anything.,696.84,700.418
SPEAKER_01," Just quite lethargic, and I just can't be bothered anymore, and my body reflects that.",701.061,708.339
SPEAKER_01, But then when I try and sleep I just can't seem to have a satisfied night's sleep.,708.8,712.833
SPEAKER_01," It's really, really frustrating.",714.8,716.391
SPEAKER_00," So it sounds like this is affecting you, it's draining you of your energy, like your body can't be bothered.",718.081,722.78
SPEAKER_00, I think that's a really good way of describing it.,722.8,724.699
SPEAKER_00, And you're noticing sleep problems as well.,724.982,726.416
SPEAKER_00," And then, what do you do?",726.84,727.911
SPEAKER_00," So this is, so we're back to the point before the lecture.",728.84,731.8
SPEAKER_00," So you start having these thoughts, these emotions, and you know, your body, I guess it sounds like those thoughts are quite draining,  so it'll be draining your energy.",731.86,738.588
SPEAKER_00," What then happens, what do you do next?",739.84,741.194
SPEAKER_01," I kind of focus on the negative thoughts, and I probably should not think about them,",742.8,747.8
SPEAKER_01, but I focus on them and then I don't really want to do anything.,748.684,751.8
SPEAKER_01, I kind of stay in bed or...,751.8,752.709
SPEAKER_00," So you think even more about those kind of worries that you have, so you do a bit of dwelling and you stay in bed.",753.84,758.636
SPEAKER_00," And it sounds like you don't, you haven't tried speaking to your friends about it.",761.8,764.413
SPEAKER_01," No, I haven't.",765.841,766.494
SPEAKER_00, Or speaking to family.,767.426,768.436
SPEAKER_00," Okay, and then after you've done that, so after you've not gone to the lecture, you've stayed in bed,  you've kind of spent time, as you said, focusing on those thoughts, those negative thoughts.",768.8,776.254
SPEAKER_00, How do you feel after that?,777.8,778.545
SPEAKER_00,Do you feel better or do you feel worse?,778.585,780.719
SPEAKER_01," I guess I feel slightly worse, but then a bit numb, in a way, kind of, I don't know.",782.8,786.047
SPEAKER_01," Once you've felt that, because I do feel tired all the time, I just try and push it out and then you don't really think about anything,  and it's almost nicer that way than to keep focusing on how much you're getting wrong and how much you can't do stuff.",791.9,804.655
SPEAKER_01, Sometimes it's better just to not think about it at all.,806.8,810.559
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like in some ways it's a bit of a relief to do that.,811.8,814.417
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,814.82,814.902
SPEAKER_00, But in other ways maybe you think it might make things worse.,815.8,818.8
SPEAKER_01," Probably in the long run, yeah.",819.002,819.911
