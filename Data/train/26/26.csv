SPEAKER_01," Yeah, 20 of them.",24.843,26.034
SPEAKER_00, A lot of pages?,26.824,27.477
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,27.701,28.273
SPEAKER_00, How'd that go?,29.334,29.64
SPEAKER_01," I mean I've seen that stuff before, but it wasn't too bad.",30.28,32.275
SPEAKER_00, Nothing surprising in there?,32.96,34.112
SPEAKER_01," No, pretty standard.",35.485,36.051
SPEAKER_00, Pretty standard.,37.184,37.552
SPEAKER_00, Nothing distressing?,37.96,38.96
SPEAKER_01, Not yet.,39.001,39.776
SPEAKER_00, Not yet?,40.103,40.429
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,41.756,41.96
SPEAKER_00, I'm going to ask you a series of questions as part of a process called intake.,42.08,49.437
SPEAKER_00, So this document that I'll be making notes on will go in your chart and it'll help guide  your care for the time that you're with me.,50.9,61.414
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,62.423,63.117
SPEAKER_00, Alright?,63.607,64.096
SPEAKER_00, So these questions are going to be more detailed and more emotionally oriented than a lot of  those questions that you were answering on the forms you filled out before.,64.28,77.556
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,78.972,79.156
SPEAKER_00, That was more like factual information that we need for insurance or record keeping.,79.36,85.538
SPEAKER_00, This is more about you and what you've been going through.,86.32,88.735
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,89.661,90.11
SPEAKER_00, You comfortable with that?,90.661,91.6
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it's okay.",91.763,92.559
SPEAKER_00, It's okay?,92.641,93.09
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,93.886,94.049
SPEAKER_00," If at any time you don't like one of the questions or you don't want to answer one of the questions,  just let me know and we'll just skip over that.",94.6,102.517
SPEAKER_01," Okay, fair enough.",103.242,103.687
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,105.714,105.939
SPEAKER_00, So what brings you in today?,106.061,106.694
SPEAKER_01, I brought myself in.,107.99,108.737
SPEAKER_01, Things have just not been fantastic so I figured I might as well get some help.,111.146,116.0
SPEAKER_01, Before it got worse.,116.282,116.948
SPEAKER_00, Things haven't been fantastic?,118.48,119.46
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,119.909,120.235
SPEAKER_00, And you're worried they're going to get worse?,121.648,122.735
SPEAKER_01," Seems like it, yeah.",123.4,124.37
SPEAKER_00, What would you say that your main problem is that motivates you to come in?,126.342,134.097
SPEAKER_01, Probably my anxiety.,135.925,137.299
SPEAKER_01, I'm just nervous about a lot of things a lot of the time and it's kind of trickling into  every area of my life now.,137.881,146.691
SPEAKER_00, So anxiety?,147.64,148.15
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,148.64,149.191
SPEAKER_00, You said it's like a nervousness?,150.325,151.855
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, just like nervousness about going places, nervousness about doing things or school or  work or you know graduating college.",152.64,160.04
SPEAKER_01, Just kind of that whole stage and it's been like that for a while.,160.341,163.918
SPEAKER_00, How long?,164.4,164.624
SPEAKER_01, I can remember as far back as like 13 or 14 maybe.,166.905,169.112
SPEAKER_00, How old are you now?,171.52,172.146
SPEAKER_01,23,173.52,174.52
SPEAKER_00, So this is around 10 years you've been coping with this?,174.52,177.52
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, off and on, yeah.",177.54,178.631
SPEAKER_00, Off and on?,179.724,180.071
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,180.969,181.112
SPEAKER_00, So there's times when you're not anxious?,181.54,182.52
SPEAKER_01, Not as bad.,182.54,183.193
SPEAKER_01, I mean I'm still anxious but not as extreme or I don't deal with it in the same way.,184.062,187.955
SPEAKER_00," If you were to rate your anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being really no anxiety  and 10 being the worst it's been in the last 10 years, how much anxiety do you have right",190.282,202.878
SPEAKER_00, now?,203.52,203.581
SPEAKER_01, I think a 6.,204.52,204.882
SPEAKER_00, When was the last time you were a 10?,208.224,209.329
SPEAKER_01, Last weekend?,211.842,212.648
SPEAKER_00, When was the last time you were a 1?,215.626,216.59
SPEAKER_01, I'm not really sure.,219.446,220.292
SPEAKER_00, Approximately?,221.683,222.5
SPEAKER_01, Maybe like a couple months ago when I was just hanging out with my friends.,222.68,230.097
SPEAKER_01, We went out and we were partying a little bit and it was nice.,231.52,234.52
SPEAKER_01, I wasn't too anxious.,234.621,236.278
SPEAKER_00, About a couple months ago?,236.904,238.035
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,238.785,239.051
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,239.561,239.806
SPEAKER_00, So the anxiety is one problem.,241.626,244.52
SPEAKER_00, Any other problems?,244.642,245.52
SPEAKER_01, I don't think it's a huge problem but I have been drinking a lot.,245.54,251.259
SPEAKER_01, But it helps with the anxiety but it makes going out and you know I'm more relaxed that  way.,252.223,256.826
SPEAKER_01, But I can be kind of a compulsive person so once I start I keep going.,258.54,263.52
SPEAKER_01, So it's not all the time.,263.56,265.48
SPEAKER_01, It's just happening when I'm going out but I end up drinking too much.,265.52,269.359
SPEAKER_00, So sometimes when you go out you drink more than you want to?,270.383,274.4
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,274.581,274.765
SPEAKER_00, What happens then?,275.621,276.288
SPEAKER_01, I make bad decisions or I get sick or the next morning I'm showing up hungover going  to class.,278.483,284.847
SPEAKER_01, If I make class and you know it's fun for the time being but it's not fun afterwards.,285.52,293.478
SPEAKER_00, So the consequences of drinking in the longer run.,294.741,297.716
SPEAKER_00, You're not too fond of those but in the short run.,299.245,300.997
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,302.275,302.52
SPEAKER_01, It helps in the moment.,302.721,304.108
SPEAKER_00, So you want the anxiety to be lessened.,306.52,309.52
SPEAKER_00, Do you want the drinking to be lessened?,310.164,311.574
SPEAKER_01, Probably.,312.826,313.275
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,314.336,314.52
SPEAKER_01, I mean I'd like to still have fun in college but I would like to not be like blacking out  or being able to stop would be nice.,314.801,322.379
SPEAKER_00, Is that what happens now?,322.561,323.52
SPEAKER_00, You black out?,323.683,324.52
SPEAKER_01, Occasionally.,324.969,325.398
SPEAKER_01, Not every time but sometimes.,325.785,326.52
SPEAKER_00, Sometimes?,326.622,327.01
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,327.561,327.785
SPEAKER_00, Do you remember the last time you blacked out?,328.621,329.954
SPEAKER_01, Maybe a month ago.,330.842,333.5
SPEAKER_00, Month ago?,333.724,334.296
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,334.663,334.867
SPEAKER_01, It's not all the time though.,338.247,339.278
SPEAKER_00, What age did you start drinking?,340.346,341.594
SPEAKER_01,14,342.52,343.52
SPEAKER_00, 14?,343.52,344.52
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,344.847,345.051
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,347.54,348.214
SPEAKER_00, Any other problems?,348.581,349.377
SPEAKER_00,You have anxiety,349.52,350.357
SPEAKER_00,You have drinking alcohol,351.124,353.097
SPEAKER_00, Any other problems?,354.288,354.853
SPEAKER_01, I don't think so.,356.55,357.257
SPEAKER_00, So those are the two main things that are bothering you.,357.882,361.399
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,361.54,361.908
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,362.581,363.255
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,366.316,366.52
SPEAKER_00, So I want to ask you some questions about your history.,366.821,371.52
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,372.193,372.418
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,372.724,373.01
SPEAKER_00, And I'm going to try to divide this up into different areas and just kind of move from  one area to the next.,373.902,379.5
SPEAKER_00, There will be some overlap.,379.52,380.52
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,380.642,380.969
SPEAKER_00, So if I ask you the same question more than once it's just kind of part of that overlap  that occurs.,382.303,387.418
SPEAKER_00, First I'd like to cover your family history.,389.95,392.5
SPEAKER_00, So can you tell me about your immediate family?,393.688,395.359
SPEAKER_01, I have one sister.,396.803,398.338
SPEAKER_01, Mom and dad.,401.146,401.712
SPEAKER_01, Pretty typical.,403.409,403.934
SPEAKER_01, My sister is really successful.,407.025,408.5
SPEAKER_01, She's a doctor.,409.985,410.712
SPEAKER_01, Though are my parents really successful too.,411.882,413.976
SPEAKER_01, So basic family.,415.611,416.217
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,417.928,418.234
SPEAKER_00, What type of relationship do you have with your sister?,418.52,421.816
SPEAKER_01," Kind of like a Merry Christmas, Happy Easter type of relationship.",423.56,427.556
SPEAKER_01, We're more like acquaintances than we are siblings.,429.264,432.52
SPEAKER_00, Would you describe it as distant?,433.449,434.52
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I'd say so.",434.52,435.52
SPEAKER_01, I mean we're nice.,435.826,436.418
SPEAKER_01," We're not like, but we're not going to be like involved in each other's lives really.",437.042,441.697
SPEAKER_00, Do you know what caused the relationship to end up that way?,443.182,447.416
SPEAKER_01, I don't know.,450.449,450.853
SPEAKER_01, She was always kind of the ideal child.,452.944,454.5
SPEAKER_01, She went and did everything that she was supposed to do and it was easy for her.,454.58,457.897
SPEAKER_01, So constantly being compared to that doesn't really foster a great relationship.,460.52,464.737
SPEAKER_00, Who compared you to your sister?,465.884,467.136
SPEAKER_01, My dad usually.,468.985,469.934
SPEAKER_01, Sometimes my mom.,472.126,472.914
SPEAKER_01, Depends on the day.,473.54,474.132
SPEAKER_00," Was this a frequent occurrence, the comparison?",475.783,477.52
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, for sure.",478.328,479.459
SPEAKER_00, Do you feel like it had an impact on you?,480.803,482.278
SPEAKER_01, Probably.,483.847,484.255
SPEAKER_01," It wasn't like I wasn't trying, but not everything can be as easy as it is for some people.",486.822,490.5
SPEAKER_01, So a little acknowledgement might be nice.,490.922,494.239
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so let's move out a little further.",497.005,498.52
SPEAKER_00," So you talked about your mother, your father, your sister.",498.56,503.436
SPEAKER_00,Any other siblings?,503.497,504.159
SPEAKER_01, No.,505.112,505.193
SPEAKER_00, How about grandparents?,505.641,506.874
SPEAKER_01, They're around.,509.54,510.03
SPEAKER_01," Typical grandparents, not super involved, but they're there sometimes.",512.244,514.877
SPEAKER_00, Good relationship?,516.227,517.015
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I mean, you know, grandparents show up and it's always like,  hi, how's it going?",517.862,522.112
SPEAKER_01, And you see them at the next holiday type of thing.,523.023,525.359
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so there's not one grandparent you're particularly close to?",526.52,529.48
SPEAKER_01, I do have one grandfather I talk to on a more personal level than I would my other ones.,531.002,536.38
SPEAKER_01, But that's gotten more distant in the past couple of years.,537.304,539.957
SPEAKER_00," How about aunts, uncles, cousins?",544.023,547.138
SPEAKER_01, I have a couple of cousins that I would hang out with or I'll see out when I'm hanging out with my friends or whatever.,548.464,552.46
SPEAKER_01, So we'll hang out if we run into each other.,554.426,556.017
SPEAKER_01, Aunts and uncles I do have.,557.781,559.187
SPEAKER_01,"They're not super involved either, but everybody's cordial.",559.207,562.138
SPEAKER_00, Everybody's cordial?,562.904,564.156
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, nice when they see you type of thing.",564.641,566.379
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,568.296,568.52
SPEAKER_00," So when's the last time you spoke, say for example, with one of your cousins?",572.661,577.46
SPEAKER_01," I think I ran into one of them only two weeks ago, or just out.",578.801,582.419
SPEAKER_00, A couple weeks ago?,582.561,583.255
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,583.642,583.969
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,585.826,586.357
SPEAKER_00," Do any of the relatives that you mentioned, are any of them aware of your anxiety and or your drinking?",587.222,594.36
SPEAKER_01, My parents are.,595.173,595.5
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,595.52,595.744
SPEAKER_00, Nobody else?,598.908,599.336
SPEAKER_01, My sister knows about the anxiety part of it.,599.742,601.459
SPEAKER_01," And I think, I'm pretty sure she knows about the drinking, but she doesn't bring it up.",602.761,606.48
SPEAKER_01," But if my parents know, I'm sure she knows.",608.386,610.359
SPEAKER_00, Hmm.,611.602,611.765
SPEAKER_00, So you believe that they told her?,613.56,615.48
SPEAKER_01, I'm sure.,615.867,616.153
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,616.806,616.908
SPEAKER_00, But she's not mentioned that to you directly?,619.54,620.995
SPEAKER_01," No, we don't have those types of conversations.",621.981,624.947
SPEAKER_01,"It's more like, oh, she messed up again, and it's just sort of like this funny thing and then they move on.",625.007,630.799
SPEAKER_00, Hmm.,632.724,632.928
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,633.561,634.03
SPEAKER_00, So you see this bothers you?,635.661,636.732
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,637.949,638.132
SPEAKER_01, It's annoying.,638.622,639.52
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,640.602,640.785
SPEAKER_00," Some of these topics that we're going to touch on in this intake, we can talk about in greater detail later on.",645.121,653.48
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,653.52,653.602
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so, and maybe your relationship with your mother and father and your sister would be topics we could touch on later on, maybe not, but I want to let you know that we can come back to anything and review it.",654.62,667.52
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,667.785,667.949
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,668.52,668.704
SPEAKER_00, So I want to move kind of out of family history a bit and through to social relationships.,670.442,677.52
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,677.52,677.602
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,678.641,679.025
SPEAKER_00,"Again, it's kind of similar, a little bit of overlap here.",679.045,680.5
SPEAKER_00," Can you tell me about any romantic interests, friends, anything like that?",682.122,687.339
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I have a guy I've been seeing for like six months, so it's pretty serious for college.",687.721,692.46
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,693.071,693.336
SPEAKER_01," And some of my college friends I'm really close with, so they're there with me for a lot.",694.801,698.48
SPEAKER_00, About how many?,699.561,700.52
SPEAKER_01, There's three girls that I'm super close with.,702.227,703.439
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,703.52,703.826
SPEAKER_01," And, you know, college, there's a lot of people I'm acquaintances with or I'll see or talk to in class or whatever, but those three girls are kind of the ones I would go to if I needed something.",705.602,713.52
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,716.683,717.296
SPEAKER_00, And then you have some other friends that you're not as close to?,718.205,720.48
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,720.72,721.021
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, we're nice and we have fun and, you know, I'm sure if something happened they would bail me out, but they're not like people I'm going to talk to about my problems or anything like that.",721.181,729.179
SPEAKER_00, Do they know about your problems?,729.823,730.833
SPEAKER_01, I don't know.,733.725,734.226
SPEAKER_01,"I guess you could know, like, when I show up to class if I'm over, but I'm sure I'm not the only one doing that, so.",734.928,740.079
SPEAKER_00," And how about the guy you've seen for six months, does he know about your problems?",742.801,746.319
SPEAKER_01," Somewhat, yeah.",747.201,747.962
SPEAKER_01,"He knows about, definitely knows about the anxiety and he's with me a lot when I go out, so if something does happen he's usually helping me out or making sure I get home or whatever.",748.363,758.5
SPEAKER_00, So he's supportive?,759.785,760.52
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, really supportive.",761.724,762.459
SPEAKER_00, Alright.,764.744,765.112
SPEAKER_00," So some of the questions I'm going to ask you, this gives me a good opportunity to talk about this, I probably could guess the answer to, but I still want to ask, not be presumptuous.",768.163,777.5
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,777.765,778.01
SPEAKER_00, Do you have any children?,778.908,779.52
