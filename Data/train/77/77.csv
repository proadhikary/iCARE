SPEAKER_00,26.52,31.518, Any other evidence that points toward you being an imposter?
SPEAKER_01,32.2,35.38, Besides my bad grade that I got that one time.
SPEAKER_01,35.46,36.344, Not a whole lot.
SPEAKER_00,40.38,47.775, So it would be safe to say that a lot of that thought of I'm not good enough is kind of  based on these feelings of anxiety.
SPEAKER_01,48.68,52.411," Which are really intense, like panic almost in the moment."
SPEAKER_00,55.6,61.799," So in a way, you're believing what the anxiety would lead you to believe."
SPEAKER_01,62.241,63.473," Yeah, definitely."
SPEAKER_00,64.28,73.319," But in the bright light of scrutiny, there aren't a lot of facts to support the worst  case which is you don't deserve it."
SPEAKER_01,73.4,73.522, Right.
SPEAKER_00,75.196,75.339, Right.
SPEAKER_00,75.621,79.675, How about evidence that refutes that you're not good enough?
SPEAKER_01,81.321,85.217," I would say that, you know, I was accepted into the program."
SPEAKER_01,85.92,96.798, Like there's kind of like a pretty rigorous sort of testing and stuff which I passed to  get in interviews and such to get into the program.
SPEAKER_01,97.04,97.734, So I did that.
SPEAKER_01,98.421,105.405," Like I said, I'm a pretty good student all considering, you know, before this kind of  like was happening."
SPEAKER_00,109.353,109.595, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,110.221,114.879," So you got through a rigorous process to become a student, you're doing well."
SPEAKER_01,115.669,116.056, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,116.24,118.834," You mentioned before just the one bad grade, right?"
SPEAKER_00,120.327,120.53, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,,," So if, you know, you have friends in this program, right?"
SPEAKER_01,121.12,125.177, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,125.96,139.304," If one of them came to you with this balance of, you know, one bad grade and some anxiety  versus passing, you know, rigorous standards and doing well otherwise, what advice would  you give them?"
SPEAKER_01,141.48,164.85," I mean now that you're kind of like talking about it like a, you know, this or that sort  of thing, it makes sense I would probably say that, well, you seem to be doing pretty  well so far, you know, that anyone evaluating would look at all of the cumulative how you're  doing your performance rather than that of weight."
SPEAKER_00,169.203,173.454, Would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself?
SPEAKER_01,175.64,200.413," I think I try to sometimes, but my anxiety symptoms kind of like really like you were  saying your anxiety tells you sort of, I think I can think that, but I think my anxiety symptoms  are such in the moment that it's really hard, you know, and I'm replaying what happened  before in my head, anticipation, predicting that it will happen again."
SPEAKER_00,202.6,202.802, All right.
SPEAKER_00,204.941,208.771, So let's look at the thought and the feeling.
SPEAKER_00,212.12,223.037," If you had to rate the percentage that you believed, this thought, this belief that you are not  good enough to be in the program, like right now."
SPEAKER_01,223.46,224.032, Right now.
SPEAKER_00,224.44,232.979," So if you're here with me, how much of your mind believes that that's true?"
SPEAKER_01,233.56,245.353," I would say like, you know, a two or a three, like not very, I don't believe it very much  right now because, you know, I'm not presenting and it's just you and I, not like a group  full of people."
SPEAKER_01,245.96,248.431," So that's, that pressure is not there here."
SPEAKER_00,250.32,253.577, So right now you're really not buying the idea that you're not good enough?
SPEAKER_01,254.261,255.139," Yeah, correct."
SPEAKER_00,255.301,255.786, To be in the program.
SPEAKER_00,257.16,274.55," So now let's move to, let's say right in the, near the end of like presentation when that  anxiety is there and the classmates, they could be looking at you, they could be negatively  evaluating you, like that's what you're worried about."
SPEAKER_00,277.26,280.458," How much do you believe, believe that thought then?"
SPEAKER_01,281.36,284.14, I want to feel really confident in that moment.
SPEAKER_01,284.2,285.217, It feels very real.
SPEAKER_01,285.4,288.319, Like like any moment they're going to kick me out.
SPEAKER_01,288.52,290.715," Like I'm like, I'm just not doing well."
SPEAKER_00,291.42,292.359, It's that bad.
SPEAKER_01,292.767,292.869, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,293.4,294.58, Really intense.
SPEAKER_00,294.74,307.477," So would you, would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what's true or  not now or when you're in that state of anxiety?"
SPEAKER_01,308.16,309.16, Definitely now.
SPEAKER_01,309.52,314.137," Now when that anxiety and that, you know, heart rate and sweating is not there."
SPEAKER_00,314.92,322.07," So this evaluation, the percent that you believe that thought is true, this evaluation is more  accurate?"
SPEAKER_01,322.56,323.465," Yes, I think so."
SPEAKER_00,326.541,333.87, And how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood you're in now where  you can evaluate accurately?
SPEAKER_01,335.38,348.374," I would say, you know, when I'm not at risk of presenting, like I feel like I spend the  majority of my time, like it's not something I worry about all the time just leading up  to and then mostly that day."
SPEAKER_00,349.561,349.805, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,350.62,356.419," So the, so you're able to evaluate the way you are now the vast majority of the time."
SPEAKER_01,356.86,357.493, Right.
SPEAKER_00,357.86,361.286," There's a limited amount of time when you're not, when there's a lot of emotions going  through."
SPEAKER_01,362.409,362.572, Right.
SPEAKER_00,364.204,365.937,And in those times you're maybe a little less reliable.
SPEAKER_01,366.625,366.809, Right.
SPEAKER_01,367.44,368.184, Like my judgment is clouded.
SPEAKER_00,371.46,374.758," However in that moment you still, those beliefs are strong, right?"
SPEAKER_01,375.384,375.527, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,376.18,376.343, Buried.
SPEAKER_00,377.751,378.078, And troubling.
SPEAKER_00,378.18,383.357," Even though it's a small percentage, it's intense and you kind of carry that around  with you a little bit."
SPEAKER_01,383.5,383.745," Yeah, exactly."
SPEAKER_00,384.681,387.017, So I can see how this is frustrating for you.
SPEAKER_01,387.542,387.708, Right.
