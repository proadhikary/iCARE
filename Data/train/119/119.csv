SPEAKER_00,14.198,15.22," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."
SPEAKER_00,15.661,17.234, I hope you find this video useful.
SPEAKER_00,17.96,20.936," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_00,21.74,23.149," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,24.96,25.203," Hello, Sophia."
SPEAKER_00,26.703,27.754, How are you doing today?
SPEAKER_01,28.38,28.666, I'm good. How are you?
SPEAKER_00,29.781,30.312, I'm doing well.
SPEAKER_00,30.72,31.408, Thanks for asking.
SPEAKER_00,32.56,41.377," I saw you last time a week ago, and I know you had some concerns with employment, working on employment."
SPEAKER_00,43.423,47.82," But first, before we get into that, I wanted to check in to see how you're doing emotionally."
SPEAKER_00,47.86,55.555," I know from last week, on a scale of 1 to 10, you said your depression was about 7."
SPEAKER_00,58.16,59.649, How is it today?
SPEAKER_01,62.064,63.458, It's been up and down.
SPEAKER_01,63.78,68.977," I think today it's probably a 7 again, but, you know, I've been back down to a 9 lately."
SPEAKER_01,70.08,74.813, I guess maybe I feel a little better because I'm coming here and I know I get to talk about it a little bit.
SPEAKER_01,76.864,89.879," But I guess last time we were talking about me trying to get a job, a full-time job, and  I think I just realized last week that it's really hard for me to work full-time."
SPEAKER_01,90.601,100.517," Right now, I'm doing the part-time thing with the work program, and they want us to do volunteer work in the afternoon if we haven't found a full-time job by a certain week."
SPEAKER_01,101.44,103.892,"And I'm just, you know, just thinking about it."
SPEAKER_01,105.821,107.359, I just don't think I can do that.
SPEAKER_01,107.541,110.198, I just don't think I can work a full 8 hours every day.
SPEAKER_01,110.56,111.311, It's just too much.
SPEAKER_00,112.5,123.089," So, you're having some concerns about full-time work and that level of energy you'd have to  exert and that commitment."
SPEAKER_00,124.5,129.817," Alright, so, would it be okay today if we kind of structured what we're going to do for this session?"
SPEAKER_00,131.04,141.29," So, if it's okay with you, I'd like to talk about that and get some more details about  what's going on this week and your feelings surrounding that."
SPEAKER_00,144.28,158.995," And, we touched on this a little bit in the last session, but I'd like to talk about your core  beliefs, your central beliefs that might be contributing to some of these feelings of depression."
SPEAKER_00,161.001,171.456," And then, for the last part, we'll work on, like we did before, some interventions to  try to help you with what's going on at work and with your depressed mood."
SPEAKER_00,172.72,174.699, We can make changes to this as needed.
SPEAKER_00,175.202,178.88, I just want to start with an outline that we can have going in.
SPEAKER_00,179.183,180.799, Does that make sense?
SPEAKER_00,181.847,183.258, Anything you want to add or take away from that?
SPEAKER_01,183.541,184.995," No, I mean, that makes sense."
SPEAKER_00,185.602,185.847," Okay, great."
SPEAKER_00,187.042,190.998," So, tell me a little bit more about what's going on with the work."
SPEAKER_01,191.943,194.156," Well, I mean, I don't really know why it is."
SPEAKER_01,195.0,198.799, I know I'm always tired because I just have so much trouble sleeping.
SPEAKER_01,199.08,205.158," As I told you before, it's just, it doesn't matter how tired I am, I can't sleep."
SPEAKER_01,205.92,215.474," But it's just, I go in the morning, you know, 8 to noon, but then in the afternoon, it's  just like, it's so hard to keep going on."
SPEAKER_01,216.4,220.769," It's just such a long amount of time and I just feel like, I don't know if I can really  do it."
SPEAKER_01,221.74,229.711," Especially in the winter, you know, if you work 8 hours, by the time you get out of work,  it's dark out and it just makes my depression so much worse."
SPEAKER_00,232.481,237.059, So the latter part of the day is more of a struggle for you.
SPEAKER_01,237.625,237.809, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,238.36,239.491, The latter part of the work day.
SPEAKER_01,241.176,241.36, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,241.501,245.698," So, getting up in the morning, getting to work on time, you do okay with that?"
SPEAKER_01,246.1,250.118," It's hard, it's hard, but I feel like I'm better at that."
SPEAKER_01,251.25,251.859, I'm better at it.
SPEAKER_01,251.9,257.821," I'm already up anyway, so, you know, I know I gotta get up, I gotta do what I have to  do."
SPEAKER_00,260.98,264.757," So the work program you're in now, you work in the morning?"
SPEAKER_01,265.3,265.422, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,266.644,267.554, What hours are you there?
SPEAKER_01,268.121,268.57, 8 to noon.
SPEAKER_00,269.06,270.38," 8 to noon, okay."
SPEAKER_00,270.38,272.693, And there's some work you have to do in the afternoon?
SPEAKER_01,273.82,289.099," Well, yeah, when, since I've been there for, uh, what is it, 8 weeks, and I haven't found  a job yet, they want us to volunteer in the afternoon, and they find us our own place to volunteer, so that's good."
SPEAKER_01,289.18,299.218," I don't have to find that myself, but I guess they want to get you used to doing something  for 8 hours a day and maybe have something to put on your resume."
SPEAKER_01,299.66,320.994," I guess when you have like a big gap in your resume, that doesn't look good either, so  I'm also being able to say I worked here even though I didn't make money, but just thinking  about it, it's so exhausting, and, you know, if I get out of the work program and I think  if I had to go to, I can barely make it home, it's just so, all I want to do is go home."
SPEAKER_00,323.38,324.38, Thinking about it's exhausting.
SPEAKER_01,324.707,325.013, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,325.38,327.011, Can you tell me what type of thoughts you're having?
SPEAKER_01,328.38,338.9," I just don't think I can do it, like, I just don't think I'm the kind of person that can  work 8 hours a day, and it just makes me feel like, what's the point?"
SPEAKER_01,339.06,340.186," Like, I'm going to work 8 hours a day?"
SPEAKER_01,342.58,343.508, I don't think I can.
SPEAKER_00,345.06,346.04, It's just too many hours.
SPEAKER_01,346.102,346.185, Yeah.
