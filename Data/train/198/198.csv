SPEAKER_01, And I've embarrassed my family by failing.,51.221,53.537
SPEAKER_01, I just don't know what to do anymore.,55.067,56.456
SPEAKER_01, I guess I've come here today to tell you I want to leave uni.,57.361,62.759
SPEAKER_01, I guess that's why I've come here today.,63.141,65.174

SPEAKER_00, All too much.,94.545,95.232
SPEAKER_01, So I imagine you've been sweating on this for a while and it's all been swirling around in your head?,96.181,101.0
SPEAKER_01," Yes, just been building up and building up.",101.0,103.0
SPEAKER_01, And so much pressure with everything.,103.302,105.436
SPEAKER_01," I'm living at home, so my parents, a lot of pressure.",106.121,108.839
SPEAKER_01, I need to do everything right.,109.242,110.611
SPEAKER_01," By failing this, I feel like I've just embarrassed them and disappointed them.",112.522,116.016
SPEAKER_01, I just don't feel like I'm good enough to go on studying.,117.04,120.578
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,121.061,121.384
SPEAKER_00, Have they said much to you about failing your exam?,123.0,125.295
SPEAKER_01, They haven't said much.,126.303,127.697
SPEAKER_01," I was really scared to tell them actually, because I knew they'd just be so disappointed  and just embarrassed by the fact that I did fail.",128.12,134.973
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I've never failed anything before.",136.0,137.993

SPEAKER_01, It's really hard.,140.141,141.535
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, so it's new and you don't like it at all?",142.0,145.0
SPEAKER_01," Not at all, no.",145.0,145.707
SPEAKER_01," I think leaving uni will just be the way out, just so I don't have to go through it again.",147.642,153.0
SPEAKER_00," Right, okay.",153.687,154.616
SPEAKER_00," Well, I'm glad you've come to counselling, because it's good for us to get an outsider's opinion  when we've got so much on our plate and we're confused as to what to do and our emotions can get in the way.",155.361,169.0
SPEAKER_00, And you've just said earlier that a whole lot of stuff's on your plate at the moment.,169.764,173.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, a lot of stuff, yeah.",173.141,174.556
SPEAKER_00, So I'm glad you've come here.,175.081,177.013
SPEAKER_00," Here at the clinic, we use the ABC model, which is a cognitive behavioural therapy model.",178.883,184.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,185.0,185.082
SPEAKER_00," So, Marsha, some counsellors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use  and we don't realise that we're using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones.",186.622,196.719
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,197.02,197.184
SPEAKER_00, Here's the list here.,198.0,199.091
SPEAKER_00, Have a look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at the moment.,200.0,206.416
SPEAKER_01, I think number two.,208.242,209.172
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,210.061,210.673
SPEAKER_00, Read that one out for me.,211.061,211.98
SPEAKER_01, That it's necessary to have a high degree of order and certainty in order to be happy and perform well.,212.221,217.0
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, yeah, you mentioned that earlier.",217.242,218.859
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,219.02,219.796
SPEAKER_01, Number four.,220.081,222.94
SPEAKER_01, That it's necessary to be competent and successful in all those things which are attempted.,223.863,228.0
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's an expectation from your family.",229.349,231.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,231.143,231.367
SPEAKER_01, Possibly number eight.,235.855,236.819
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,237.224,237.49
SPEAKER_01," That life should be entirely pleasant and enjoyable and that any frustration, discomfort or pain would be unbearable.",238.0,243.639
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,244.02,244.444
SPEAKER_00," Which one of those stands out the most for you at the moment, Marsha?",246.422,250.739
SPEAKER_01, Probably number four.,251.202,252.192
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,253.653,253.959
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,254.0,254.184
SPEAKER_00, How would you put that in your own words?,255.121,256.737
SPEAKER_01, That I need to be successful all the time in everything that I do.,257.563,260.94
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,261.081,261.303
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,263.224,263.571
SPEAKER_00, And is that different from what's happening in your life at the moment?,264.281,267.775
SPEAKER_01," Well, failing that exam, I mean, I wasn't successful with that.",269.241,272.859
SPEAKER_01," So, yeah, I mean, it just throws out, I guess even number two, because it throws out all the order in my life.",273.0,278.0
SPEAKER_01," I need to have everything, you know, so I need to know what I'm doing, where I'm going.",278.321,283.96
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, so.",284.101,284.747
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,286.571,286.816
SPEAKER_00," So if number four is an expectation that your family have and that you have of yourself, how do you measure up next to number four?",287.1,295.98
SPEAKER_01, I don't feel like I'm good enough.,296.828,298.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,298.327,298.469
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,299.347,299.653
SPEAKER_00, All right.,300.735,300.98
SPEAKER_00," Well, what I'd like to do is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC and I'll explain as we go along.",301.0,306.9
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,307.0,307.122
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,308.49,308.796
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,309.02,309.327
SPEAKER_00, So what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment?,310.08,313.658
SPEAKER_01," I mean, there are a lot of things, but I think obviously failing the exam was the main one.",314.0,319.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,319.02,319.347
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,320.102,320.224
SPEAKER_00, All right.,321.041,321.857
SPEAKER_00, And the consequence is you thinking of leaving?,322.844,325.96
SPEAKER_01," I live in uni, yeah.",326.02,326.878
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,327.673,327.837
SPEAKER_00, All right.,328.041,328.429
SPEAKER_00, And that statement that you made earlier about I'm not good enough.,329.864,333.0
SPEAKER_01," I'm not good enough, yeah.",333.0,333.98
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's the B one.",334.0,335.0
SPEAKER_00, That's the crucial one.,335.041,336.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,336.0,336.122
SPEAKER_00, And I'll explain it shortly when I get up to the board.,337.081,339.919
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,340.102,340.388
SPEAKER_00, All right.,341.02,341.959
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,342.041,342.143
SPEAKER_00, I think I'll put it up there now for you so we can work through that.,343.0,346.739
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,347.653,347.837
SPEAKER_00," So, Marsha, the activating event, which is what you stated earlier.",348.02,352.0
SPEAKER_01, I failed my exam.,352.545,353.616
SPEAKER_00, That's right.,354.12,354.681
SPEAKER_00, And the kind of decision that you're thinking about is?,365.02,368.216
SPEAKER_01, Leaving uni.,369.143,369.796
SPEAKER_00," That's right, yeah.",370.1,371.003
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,378.303,378.606
SPEAKER_00, So it's important that we consider the jump from here over to here and the kind of thinking that you've been swirling around in your head affects the consequence.,380.2,392.279
SPEAKER_00, And you've mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit.,393.221,397.0
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,397.0,397.122
SPEAKER_00, And you put that in your own words.,398.02,398.959
SPEAKER_00, What were your words before?,399.0,399.939
SPEAKER_01, That I'm not good enough.,400.061,400.98
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, good.",401.08,401.561
SPEAKER_00, It's really important for us to consider that kind of thinking.,420.045,423.0
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,423.0,423.161
SPEAKER_00," Okay, Marsha, it's good that we've got those things on the board.",428.685,431.0
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,431.02,431.429
SPEAKER_00, And what I'd like to do now is focus stepping out a bit from your situation and looking at it from another point of view.,432.381,441.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,442.0,442.571
SPEAKER_00, To me it sounds like you're doing a whole lot of things really well.,444.305,448.0
SPEAKER_00, Can you list all of the things that you're doing really well?,448.886,451.0
SPEAKER_01, I'm working.,452.424,452.828
SPEAKER_01, It's a really demanding job and I'm keeping up with it.,454.744,458.0
SPEAKER_00," Great, yeah.",458.449,458.898
SPEAKER_01, So I guess work.,459.0,459.959
SPEAKER_01," Things with my fiance, I mean, we're engaged, so planning the wedding.",462.607,467.0
SPEAKER_01, That's going really well.,467.04,468.717
SPEAKER_01," It's stressful, but it's going well.",469.747,471.0
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,471.0,471.143
SPEAKER_00, And all of your other university subjects?,474.05,475.839
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I've never felt anything before.",476.302,479.0
SPEAKER_01," This is the first one, so I guess all the other subjects, yeah.",479.241,482.98
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, yeah.",483.122,484.0
SPEAKER_00, And you're succeeding in all of those things.,485.047,486.94
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,487.0,487.327
SPEAKER_00, Put together.,488.082,488.918
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,489.408,489.735
SPEAKER_00," You're juggling it and it's a lot on your plate at the moment, but it sounds like you've been able to cope up until this point of the one exam.",490.18,499.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,499.02,499.388
SPEAKER_01, This one just threw me off balance.,500.525,502.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, just failing, yeah.",502.429,503.0
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,503.592,503.755
SPEAKER_00, So would you describe yourself as successful most of the time?,505.06,509.518
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, most of the time.",510.828,512.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,512.367,512.612
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,513.02,513.551
SPEAKER_00, And what's the evidence for that?,514.0,514.869
SPEAKER_01, Passing all my exams all the time.,516.02,517.838
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,518.02,518.163
SPEAKER_01," Just passing my subjects, not just exams.",519.0,520.919
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's right.",521.0,522.0
SPEAKER_01," Getting that full-time job, it's a great job that I'm doing.",522.382,525.94
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,526.102,526.347
SPEAKER_00, You're getting married.,528.071,528.919
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's right.",529.388,529.98
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,530.0,530.306
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,531.163,531.449
SPEAKER_00, So how do all of those successes compare to that belief that I've written on the board for you?,532.341,539.597
SPEAKER_01," I guess in comparison, I am good enough.",541.984,545.92
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's right.",546.224,546.939
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,547.204,547.633
SPEAKER_00, And all the evidence is there.,548.727,549.899
SPEAKER_00, All of the subjects that you've passed in first year and now second year.,550.302,554.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,554.061,554.306
SPEAKER_00, You're a full-time job.,555.0,556.778
SPEAKER_00, That's a success.,557.02,557.551

SPEAKER_01, It's great.,559.286,559.878
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, good.",560.184,561.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,561.184,561.898
SPEAKER_00," Well, what I'd like to do is get you to write that on the board.",563.065,566.0
SPEAKER_01, All right.,566.163,566.429
SPEAKER_00, To dispute that belief.,567.949,569.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,569.0,569.286
SPEAKER_00, Okay?,570.061,570.551
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,571.0,571.204
SPEAKER_00, Would you do that?,572.082,572.918
SPEAKER_01, All right.,573.408,573.633
SPEAKER_00," Well done, Marsha.",599.318,600.0
SPEAKER_00, That's a powerful statement.,600.141,601.717
SPEAKER_00, What kind of decision goes along with that?,602.342,604.477
SPEAKER_01, Staying at uni.,606.01,606.758
SPEAKER_00, Good.,607.265,607.469
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,608.612,608.878
SPEAKER_00, Write that on the board for us.,609.0,609.837
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,610.449,610.531
SPEAKER_00, Great.,622.899,623.7
SPEAKER_00, That's good.,623.861,626.155
SPEAKER_00, Good.,627.383,627.523
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,630.904,631.005
SPEAKER_00," So you've made a bit of a decision there, haven't you?",634.341,637.815
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,639.102,639.347
SPEAKER_00, Tell me about it.,640.102,641.0
SPEAKER_00, Does it feel okay?,641.606,642.475
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,643.531,643.755
SPEAKER_01, I feel like I should stay.,644.646,646.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,646.041,646.735
SPEAKER_00, Why is that?,647.848,648.354
SPEAKER_01, I can try again.,649.612,650.0
SPEAKER_00, Right.,650.0,650.102
SPEAKER_01," I mean, everything doesn't have to be 100% all the time.",651.0,652.993
SPEAKER_00," Good, good.",654.02,654.837
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,655.061,655.306
SPEAKER_01," So, I mean, I could re-sit the exam.",656.081,657.96
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,658.02,658.408
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, yeah.",659.202,660.414
SPEAKER_00, And we've talked about all your successes.,661.889,662.96
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,663.02,663.102
SPEAKER_00, So it's harder now to believe that top statement that I'm not good enough.,665.12,669.799
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,670.367,670.735
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I am good enough compared to all the things that you helped me realize with all  the successes that I've had.",671.0,677.495
SPEAKER_00, That's right.,678.0,678.918
SPEAKER_01, I am good enough.,679.0,679.571
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,680.0,680.184
SPEAKER_00, Good.,681.163,681.429

SPEAKER_00," And so this idea about staying at uni, tell me about that.",683.261,686.96
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I'll say.",687.02,687.469
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I am good enough, so I'm sure I can give it another go and see how I go from there.",688.301,693.0
SPEAKER_01, I can re-sit the exam and I'm sure I'll be fine.,693.02,694.99
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,697.0,697.184
SPEAKER_00, Good.,698.735,698.898
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,699.531,699.816
SPEAKER_00," What I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement, I am good enough.",700.301,705.0
SPEAKER_00, Say it in front of the mirror two or three times a day so that you build up your confidence  because it's going to take some time to reprogram your computer up here with that kind of positive  belief about yourself rather than carrying around that other belief.,706.104,723.297
SPEAKER_00," And we tend to carry those other beliefs for years and years and years, and so it's going  to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief  system.",724.02,734.531
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,735.245,735.408
SPEAKER_00," But you've made a great start here today, so congratulations.",736.0,738.49
SPEAKER_01, Thank you.,741.101,742.106
