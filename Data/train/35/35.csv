SPEAKER_00,0.761,16.418," Hi Sarah, how are you doing today?"
SPEAKER_01,18.102,18.796, I'm doing okay.
SPEAKER_01,19.0,22.658, Could be a little better but I could always be worse but I'm doing okay.
SPEAKER_00,23.51,23.776, Doing okay.
SPEAKER_00,24.0,27.091, I understand you have some symptoms that have been bothering you?
SPEAKER_01,29.68,30.66, They have been bothering me.
SPEAKER_01,31.304,33.398," Well, I just started back to school last year."
SPEAKER_01,33.841,38.419, I was staying at home while my husband was working but the kids are crawling out of the house.
SPEAKER_01,38.741,40.256, So I said I was going to go back to school.
SPEAKER_01,40.921,44.66, I haven't been in school in 20 years and I thought I could handle it.
SPEAKER_01,44.841,50.058, But right now I just find myself so anxious and just so worried all the time.
SPEAKER_01,52.331,53.68, And I just don't know what to do with it.
SPEAKER_01,53.841,56.172," It's been going on for around the past 7, 8 months now."
SPEAKER_00,57.862,58.67, About 7 or 8 months.
SPEAKER_01,59.741,60.149, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,61.222,67.359, Would you say that this anxiety has been affecting you more days than it doesn't?
SPEAKER_01,69.768,72.037," I would say it's been affecting me, yes."
SPEAKER_01,72.72,74.034," For some time though, yes."
SPEAKER_01,74.782,75.639," More often than not, yes."
SPEAKER_00,75.861,76.948," More often than not, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,79.542,82.752, Do you find yourself struggling to control the anxiety?
SPEAKER_01,86.343,87.327, To control it?
SPEAKER_01,88.25,89.435,I'm just anxious all the time.
SPEAKER_01,89.455,90.539,Yes.
SPEAKER_00,90.901,94.62, So it sounds like you are struggling to get under control?
SPEAKER_01,95.068,95.313, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,98.007,102.259," Tell me about how it's been affecting, you mentioned school."
SPEAKER_01,103.262,105.331, I'm not doing too well in school right now.
SPEAKER_01,105.933,106.415,Not at all.
SPEAKER_00,107.68,107.904, In what way?
SPEAKER_01,109.448,110.619, I thought I would be a better student.
SPEAKER_01,111.183,114.68, I was always a straight A student back before when I was an undergrad.
SPEAKER_01,115.468,116.599, I was always a straight A student.
SPEAKER_01,116.78,122.68, But now I'm failing and I just can't concentrate in school.
SPEAKER_01,122.721,123.007, I'm failing.
SPEAKER_01,123.941,127.66, I'm just so worried all the time about how I'm going to do in this class.
SPEAKER_00,127.7,128.619, What assignments are due.
SPEAKER_01,128.922,130.66, If I'm getting the work done in time.
SPEAKER_01,132.246,135.68," It's just controlling, it's taking over everything I do in school."
SPEAKER_01,137.101,142.66, So I'm more worried about how I'm going to do than having time to focus on my grades.
SPEAKER_01,143.771,144.68, It's just to that level.
SPEAKER_00,145.69,146.68, That's really distressing for you.
SPEAKER_01,146.7,146.925, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,148.003,149.68," And as a school, how about at home?"
SPEAKER_01,150.422,155.439," At home, I'm so worried about school that it's affecting my life at home."
SPEAKER_01,156.021,160.68," Like, I have this assignment, but then, oh my goodness, I'm so focused on this assignment."
SPEAKER_01,160.821,162.458, Will I have time to make dinner for the kids?
SPEAKER_01,162.68,165.177," My husband's going, oh, the house is such a mess all the time."
SPEAKER_01,165.842,167.68, And it's just causing so much conflict at home.
SPEAKER_01,167.981,172.68, My husband thinks I should be doing my housework and I'm so consumed with school.
SPEAKER_01,172.841,175.136, And then it's just such a big mess right now.
SPEAKER_01,175.904,176.598, So I'm constantly worried.
SPEAKER_01,177.448,178.68," When I'm at school, I'm worried about home."
SPEAKER_01,179.223,180.509," And when I'm home, I'm worried about school."
SPEAKER_00,182.801,184.559, So a good deal of worrying.
SPEAKER_01,185.109,185.619, All the time.
SPEAKER_00,185.741,186.468, All the time.
SPEAKER_00,188.394,188.619, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,189.161,195.138, So I want to ask you a few questions about this and some that might be related.

SPEAKER_00,274.884,275.027, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,277.246,278.64," How about, I need trouble sleeping."
SPEAKER_00,278.74,285.499," So this would be falling asleep, staying asleep, having unsatisfying sleep, anything like that?"
SPEAKER_01,285.901,291.379," Well, I have unsatisfying sleep but we just moved and we live next to a factory."
SPEAKER_01,292.064,293.68, There's trucks in and out all the time.
SPEAKER_01,294.003,294.811, Who can sleep with that?
SPEAKER_01,295.801,297.256," Just chronic, just noise."

SPEAKER_00,327.945,328.496, A couple of years?
SPEAKER_01,328.68,329.598, Yes.

SPEAKER_00,332.68,333.537, And the symptoms started 8 months ago.
SPEAKER_01,333.762,333.823, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,337.205,345.68," So I don't know if it's made it worse or if the noise has just been, so I don't know if  it's the noise or what."
SPEAKER_01,345.882,347.619, I can't sleep through a truck.
