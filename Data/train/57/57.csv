SPEAKER_00, you worry a lot about how you come across in social situations.,30.281,33.839
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it really makes me feel really anxious,  like what I look like and what people are thinking.",34.804,40.617
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, you said that you worry that you visibly shake.",41.704,44.739
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,45.469,45.714
SPEAKER_00, Are there any other things that you worry that people will notice?,46.603,49.518
SPEAKER_01," I think obviously the shaking, I think my hands and legs shaking  and kind of going really red and sweating and just looking really weird.",50.321,60.478
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like you have quite a strong mental image  of how you see yourself when you're in these social situations.,61.303,65.919
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, definitely.",66.163,66.571
SPEAKER_00," So you go red, you shake.",67.745,69.517
SPEAKER_00, Is there anything else that you think that you do?,70.0,71.919
SPEAKER_00," I mean, describe yourself.",72.0,73.0
SPEAKER_00, How do you think you look when you're in these situations?,73.423,75.919
SPEAKER_01," Just like, I think I just look really obviously weird and out of place  and like really red and just visibly shaking and sweating  and kind of not being able to communicate properly with people.",76.562,90.317
SPEAKER_00, Is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things  to manage these problems?,91.764,98.136
SPEAKER_01," I guess like when I'm holding the camera, I just grip onto it really, really tight  or I kind of clench on my muscles and just find something that I can focus on  and to kind of try and make myself shake less and not go as red and stuff.",99.462,116.037
SPEAKER_00," So you focus on something, you grip onto the camera.",117.242,120.0
SPEAKER_00, Do you make eye contact with people?,120.685,122.255
SPEAKER_01," No, I just tend to just look down.",123.081,125.537
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so you also avoid eye contact.",126.0,127.717
SPEAKER_00," Is there anything else that you do to manage the sweating, for example?",128.0,131.256
SPEAKER_01, Just kind of looking down and wearing all black so it's less obvious  or kind of wearing just more layers and all black so you just can't tell.,132.0,143.575
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,145.02,145.423
SPEAKER_00,"What do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things,  if you stopped gripping onto the camera or you start to make eye contact  and not looking down?",146.651,154.447
SPEAKER_00,What do you think would happen?,155.553,156.457
SPEAKER_01, I think it would be so much worse.,157.101,158.55
SPEAKER_01, I think I would just shake even more and be more anxious  and look more obviously kind of weird and out of place.,160.02,169.054
SPEAKER_00, What I'm thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment  to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things?,172.226,179.94
SPEAKER_00, If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work?,180.643,184.558
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,185.505,185.788
SPEAKER_00," If we did this maybe twice in the first time,  you do all the things that you normally do.",187.685,192.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,192.0,192.286
SPEAKER_00," You grip onto something, look down.",193.101,195.698
SPEAKER_00," Is there anything else that you do when you're in these situations,  these work conversations to try and cope?",196.443,201.693
SPEAKER_01, I just kind of fumble and kind of just clench whatever it is I'm holding  just really tight and just make sure I don't make any eye contact.,203.501,215.276
SPEAKER_01, I'll just kind of get through it.,216.926,218.195
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so in the first time I want you to do those things  as much as you normally would.",219.0,222.798
SPEAKER_00," In fact, maybe even slightly more than you normally would.",223.182,224.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,225.0,225.102
SPEAKER_00, And then the second time I want you to drop doing those things altogether.,226.0,229.94
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,230.0,230.204
SPEAKER_00, How does that sound?,231.02,231.714
SPEAKER_01, I'll try my best.,232.182,233.475
SPEAKER_00, How would you feel about if we filmed this so you could actually see what you looked like?,235.426,239.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,239.102,239.265
SPEAKER_00, Do you have a camera with you that we could video on?,240.544,242.456

SPEAKER_00," Before we do this then, we're just going to fill out this form.",248.081,249.778
SPEAKER_00, What we're doing now is an experiment.,250.444,251.899
SPEAKER_00, We call it a behavioural experiment to see what happens when you change the way that you're behaving.,252.0,256.96
SPEAKER_01, Right.,257.449,257.694
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so the first column says I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have.",258.0,263.378
SPEAKER_00, So our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work.,264.0,266.899
SPEAKER_00, Who should I play?,267.788,268.556
SPEAKER_00," If you're playing yourself in this role play, who should I be?",269.0,271.537
SPEAKER_01, Maybe like a client at work.,272.444,274.0
SPEAKER_01, At work I always have to sit down with clients before we do the shoot and get to know a little bit more about what they want.,274.0,279.819

SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I thought it was going to be a lot worse than actually it was.",650.02,654.0
SPEAKER_00,So you thought you were going to say something that was 90% stupid.,654.101,656.779
SPEAKER_00, That's really quite strong.,657.041,657.959
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,658.041,658.204
SPEAKER_00," In the end, did you pick up anything that, so could we maybe put that as a zero?",659.0,663.9
