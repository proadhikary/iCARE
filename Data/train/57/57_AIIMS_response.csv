Also, there is no information regarding the last session as well.","Presenting Symptom:  Anxiety majorly in social situations. 
Chief complaints: 
1.Sweating,
2.Body shaking
3.Heat in body which makes him visibly red, 
4.Body stiffness/ clench.",NIL,NIL,"

General appearance and behaviour: There is no description of patient's appearance in this session. He seemed cooperative and attentive. ( It's difficult to say through only transcripts  as the therapist is trying to know the details of his social anxiety and fears around it. He seems more interested in knowing his cognition and his own mental image about himself than his current experience especially in the initial part of the session); Speech: Patient's speech was fluent and coherent as he was replying and obeying to what therapist was saying regarding the experiment; Mood and Affect: As per this transcript its hard to say about his Mood and Affect, though he sounds concerned and embarrassed about his current problems he is facing in social situations;Thought: Thoughts are coherent and logical; Perception: The individual holds a negative self-perception, believing they appear ""weird"" and ""out of place"" in social situations. They worry about appearing visibly anxious and fear saying something stupid; Cognitive Functions: His attention span and concentration seems fine. He had an orientation of time and space. His memory also seems fine; Judgement and insight: He has an insight of his problem as he is able to explain all the details and understands it very well. His judgement is poor as its  quite difficult for him to separate himself from his own imagined reality where he feels that if he wont clench his body then people will find him weird , out of the place and will see will his disturbed condition.
",Type: CBT; Mode: Individual,"
1) Reflective Listening: Therapist is trying to give back whatever the patient is saying and making him think and listen to what he is saying.
2) Thought challenging- Here therapist tried to challenge his thought about his experience of anxiety and asked him to participate in the experiment to see whether he can experience any change in his body.
3) Cognitive restructuring-  Here after the experiment, therapist pointed out a change in his behaviour during the experiment and asked him to rate his anxiety again which helped in restructuring his cognition.",NIL,"There are few issues discussed in the session which are as follows: 
1. Social Anxiety: The first theme can be seen is that the patient experiences significant anxiety about how they come across in social situations, particularly at work. This anxiety manifests in physical symptoms such as shaking, sweating, and blushing.
2. Behavioural Experiment: The therapist introduced an experiment to challenge patient's beliefs about their social performance in which they do a role play of a work conversation twice, once with their usual coping mechanisms and once without using anything.
3. Reality Check: This experiment helped him to challenge his reality and see it objectively.  It was discovered that his anxiety symptoms are less severe than anticipated and that he can engage in a conversation more naturally when he tries to minimise or stops his coping strategies.
4. Changed perception: The video in the experiment made him see and reevaluates his  perceptions of his performance. He can see a visible change in his anxiety and noticed that it was not as evident to others as he had feared. This made him realise that he can be more effective in his communication when he does not try to change or control himself. 

Copying mechanisms: Gripping onto objects tightly, avoiding eye contact, and wearing black clothes to hide sweating.
