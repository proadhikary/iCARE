SPEAKER_00,5.455,7.46," Okay, Mia, great job on your homework."
SPEAKER_00,7.642,8.716, That was really excellent.
SPEAKER_00,9.0,26.635," You listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times, and you did the in vivo exposure  of walking around and touching things like doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you  normally wouldn't touch, both at your house and other places you went."
SPEAKER_00,27.98,32.807," And you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and  at your mom's house."
SPEAKER_00,34.22,34.955, And no washing.
SPEAKER_01,35.424,35.893, No washing.
SPEAKER_00,36.281,37.897," No hand washing, no extra washing."
SPEAKER_00,38.467,38.875, Perfect.
SPEAKER_00,39.181,39.793, Good for you.
SPEAKER_00,40.14,40.242, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,41.14,43.72," So what did you learn from all that, do you think, over the course of the time you've"
SPEAKER_00,43.76,44.699, done that?
SPEAKER_01,45.185,46.579," It just, it got easier."
SPEAKER_01,46.66,51.304," At the beginning it was really hard, and I feel like my stats were much higher than at  the end."
SPEAKER_01,52.58,55.42," So I guess that was what we talked about, the habituation."
SPEAKER_00,55.44,56.42," Habituation, right."
SPEAKER_00,56.86,67.078," The fact that when you do something like that that initially makes you anxious, and you  do it repeatedly, especially in prolonged periods of time, your anxiety comes down."
SPEAKER_00,67.78,70.575, We're just not built to stay indefinitely anxious.
SPEAKER_00,71.62,73.529, You notice any other changes or anything else?
SPEAKER_01,76.18,80.956," I noticed that before doing the exposures I was really, really anxious."
SPEAKER_01,82.22,87.576," And then it kind of went down, like the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed."
SPEAKER_00,88.98,90.573," Did that change by, say, yesterday?"
SPEAKER_01,91.847,91.969, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,92.52,92.622, Also.
SPEAKER_01,93.5,98.697," The stats were initially really high before the exposure, and then they went down the  more I did them."
SPEAKER_00,98.86,104.039," So you're saying you not only noticed that it went down during the exposure, but you  started feeling less anxious even approaching these tests."
SPEAKER_00,104.22,104.302, Good.
SPEAKER_00,105.22,105.893, Perfect.
SPEAKER_00,106.506,106.689, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,107.465,108.138," All right, good."
SPEAKER_00,108.383,108.506, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,109.22,112.457," All right, so you're doing so well, we're going to take another step up the hierarchy  today like we planned, right?"
SPEAKER_01,112.78,112.984, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,113.78,115.42," So this is the dog leash day, right?"
SPEAKER_00,115.644,116.256, Did you bring it?
SPEAKER_01,116.521,116.807, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,117.582,118.154," Okay, good."
SPEAKER_00,118.46,120.175," All right, we'll get to that later in the session."
SPEAKER_00,120.8,123.218," First we're going to do some imaginal exposure, okay?"
SPEAKER_00,123.54,125.034, And you remember what the purpose of that is?
SPEAKER_00,125.66,126.728, Why are we going to do imaginal?
SPEAKER_01,128.2,138.66, That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious  and eventually deal with the fear consequence.
SPEAKER_00,139.027,139.456, Exactly.
SPEAKER_01,139.7,141.016, Of getting sick in my case.
SPEAKER_00,141.89,142.053, Right.
SPEAKER_00,142.38,156.797," So the idea is this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation  in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and  not washing, not doing your rituals, right?"
SPEAKER_00,157.28,157.81," Okay, perfect."
SPEAKER_00,158.32,159.108, So did you write the story?
SPEAKER_01,160.34,160.544, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,161.32,163.28," Okay, let me see."
SPEAKER_00,163.663,164.328," All right, good."
SPEAKER_00,165.9,170.977, All about taking the dog for a walk without leash and what happens because of it.
SPEAKER_00,172.591,172.836, Excellent.
SPEAKER_00,173.122,173.918," Okay, good."
SPEAKER_00,174.02,175.473, You know this so I'm not going to ask you to read it.
SPEAKER_00,176.802,209.397," Okay, so in a minute when we start, what I'm going to ask you to do is to close your eyes  and to sort of narrate or describe this scene that you thought about it this week and wrote  out where you're handling the dog leash and very aware of the way it's contaminated and  I want you to describe in the story not just what you're doing but also what you're kind  of feeling and what you're thinking as you do this and then also leading to the consequences  you fear from handling the dog leash and not washing."
SPEAKER_00,210.183,210.367, Good.
SPEAKER_00,211.404,212.636, Any questions before you start?
SPEAKER_00,213.02,214.769," Okay, so what's your level right now?"
SPEAKER_01,216.901,217.615, I would say like a 70.
SPEAKER_00,217.88,218.187," 70, okay."
SPEAKER_00,220.229,221.86," All right, go ahead and start when you're ready."
SPEAKER_01,221.962,222.86, Should we press play?
SPEAKER_00,223.325,224.779," Oh, thank you for reminding me."
SPEAKER_00,224.92,226.974, We'll start the recording so you have that for homework.
SPEAKER_01,228.35,228.656, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,229.221,236.665," So, I'm in my house and the dog starts barking and I know that that means that I have to  take him out."
SPEAKER_01,238.58,247.938, Really don't want to so I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can  do it but I know if the dog keeps barking he's going to wake up the baby.
SPEAKER_01,248.821,254.058, So I decide to go to the front door and get the leash.
SPEAKER_01,254.88,293.456, I'm not going to wear the gloves I usually wear so I fully experience touching the leash  but I'm already feeling really anxious and I look at the leash and I see that it's gross  and it's full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and it probably has saliva and  other things and I see stains and I start thinking what if that's dog poop and I get  sick and I just feel myself shaking and really sweaty and my heart is beating really fast.
SPEAKER_01,295.46,307.237," So I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab the leash and I get  the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash."
SPEAKER_00,308.1,308.978, What's your level now Mia?
SPEAKER_00,309.222,309.835, Just real quick.
SPEAKER_01,310.937,311.08, Like 90.
SPEAKER_00,311.1,312.1,90
SPEAKER_00,312.304,312.61, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,313.1,313.569, You're doing great.
SPEAKER_00,314.182,314.916, Just keep going.
SPEAKER_01,315.1,325.928, So I grab the leash and the dog is pulling and I feel the leash kind of pushing through  my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get  sick.
SPEAKER_01,326.801,329.074, I want to vomit but I just keep going.
SPEAKER_01,330.26,341.117," So I walk the dog, come back home and I just leave the leash in the front door and I'm  thinking I'm probably going to get sick."
SPEAKER_01,341.861,356.958," I really want to wash my hands, really want to take a shower but I try not to and I stop  myself and I'm feeling really, really anxious so I can't stop thinking about washing."
SPEAKER_01,357.72,361.574," So I try to go to bed, decide to fall asleep."
SPEAKER_01,363.22,367.96, The next morning I wake up and I already feel sick.
SPEAKER_01,368.223,369.117, I know I'm sick.
SPEAKER_01,369.48,380.836," I'm shivering and I feel like I have a fever and I'm shaking again and I'm really nauseated  so I go to the bathroom, start vomiting and I know I'm sick."
SPEAKER_01,381.881,384.719, I already got something I should have washed.
SPEAKER_01,384.901,386.152, I start thinking about that.
SPEAKER_01,387.0,391.678," Going to get the baby sick and I feel really, really sick."
SPEAKER_00,392.323,392.731, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,393.16,393.548, Great job.
SPEAKER_00,394.16,395.14, What's your level now?
SPEAKER_01,395.507,395.65, Like 80.
SPEAKER_00,396.16,397.16,80
SPEAKER_00,397.629,397.813, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,398.16,398.425, All right.
SPEAKER_00,399.16,400.16, So just keep visualizing this.
SPEAKER_00,400.16,403.774, I'm going to describe it now and you just stay with that image as much as you can.
SPEAKER_00,405.28,410.333, So you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done  and do things for dinner.
SPEAKER_00,410.92,432.755, Suddenly you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart  rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know that means he needs  to go out and Joe's not going to be home for hours and you really don't want to take him  out but you have to and it makes you scared and upset because you're not going to use  the gloves that you always use when you have to take him out.
SPEAKER_00,433.68,439.955, So you walk toward the door and you think well maybe I'll just make him wait but you  realize he'll wake the baby up if you don't take him.
SPEAKER_00,440.8,455.876, So you go toward the leash and it just makes you even more anxious to see it and it's dirty  and it's chewed up and it's gross and you see stains on it and you think about what  those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you.
SPEAKER_00,456.8,520.411, And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar and as you go out the door and he lunges  outside he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash  entering your body through the pores of your skin and you feel like it's just running up  your arm through your bloodstream and you keep thinking oh my god what if I get sick  from this what if there's some germs in this or bacteria but you keep walking him until  he finishes what he has to do and you bring him back inside the house take the leash off  and the urge to wash is so powerful so strong you want to go scrub your hands and get in  the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these germs off from  the leash but you don't do that you don't you make yourself not do the ritual and then  you go back in and just keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense  of feeling sick is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked  up germs from the leash.
SPEAKER_00,521.48,556.412, That night you go to sleep still anxious still upset about what happened wake up in the morning  and then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick  you can feel your body being sick you rush to the bathroom and vomit you can feel the  fever and your body is just not right you're sick and you know it's because you handled  that leash and didn't wash you didn't do the washing you needed to do and now you're  sick and the baby will probably get sick and if only you had done the washing.
SPEAKER_00,558.9,559.443, What's your level now?
SPEAKER_01,562.122,562.449, Like 80.
SPEAKER_00,563.201,567.554, 80 okay okay you take it back and you do it again okay good job.
SPEAKER_01,569.44,574.74, Okay so I'm home and the dog starts barking.
