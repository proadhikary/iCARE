SPEAKER_00,1.242,9.138," Well, let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself."
SPEAKER_01,12.833,13.939, I'm pretty obvious.
SPEAKER_00,16.893,17.476, So what happened?
SPEAKER_00,18.24,21.12," First of all, tell me what you did exactly."
SPEAKER_01,23.032,23.958, What do you mean what I did?
SPEAKER_00,24.281,26.24," Well, I mean, where'd you cut yourself?"
SPEAKER_00,26.3,27.96, I know you said you cut yourself in a way.
SPEAKER_01,28.0,28.675, Same as always.
SPEAKER_01,29.021,29.711, Same as always.
SPEAKER_00,30.462,30.854, On your arm?
SPEAKER_01,31.04,31.202, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,32.64,33.472, Where'd you cut yourself with?
SPEAKER_01,34.0,34.346, A razor.
SPEAKER_00,35.1,35.443, How deep?
SPEAKER_01,37.36,37.954, You want to see it?
SPEAKER_00,38.241,38.427, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,38.922,39.296, Let me see.
SPEAKER_00,44.36,51.829," You know, those look to me like they, did you go to the,  it doesn't look like you went and got any stitches,  but that looks to me like you could have used them."
SPEAKER_00,54.1,54.565, What do you think?
SPEAKER_01,55.96,60.479," I think if you've ever been to a ER when you cut yourself,  you'll know why don't go."
SPEAKER_00,63.621,68.014," OK, but part of the problem is those  look deep and like you're going to have significant scars."
SPEAKER_00,69.14,74.39," So my suggestion is in the future if you do it,  is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed."
SPEAKER_00,76.8,80.755, But let's talk about how this happened.
SPEAKER_00,82.04,82.777," First of all, tell me."
SPEAKER_00,82.98,92.38," You were telling me on the phone that you  wanted to die, but was this a suicide attempt  or do you think it was just a cutting?"
SPEAKER_00,92.724,95.999, Were you thinking about killing yourself  or wanting to kill yourself or wanting  to die when you did it?
SPEAKER_01,96.04,97.113, I was thinking about killing myself.
SPEAKER_01,97.68,100.759, I thought you would help me and you didn't.
SPEAKER_01,103.442,104.619, That's what I want to talk about.
SPEAKER_01,104.68,112.037, I want to talk about how it is that my life is not  going better and you are not helping me  and you are not available to me when I need help.
SPEAKER_00,112.521,112.642, OK.
SPEAKER_00,114.14,119.03, So it sounds like was me not being  available to you related to you cutting yourself?
SPEAKER_01,121.2,122.672, I cut myself the first time.
SPEAKER_01,123.661,125.257, I called you thinking you would help me.
SPEAKER_01,125.54,126.298, You wouldn't help me.
SPEAKER_01,126.42,127.638," So then I figured, what the hell?"
SPEAKER_01,127.82,129.098, I might as well just go all the way.
SPEAKER_01,129.28,131.012, And so that's why I cut myself that deep.
