SPEAKER_01,37.361,62.172," Nothing to be suspect specific or anything,  "

Narrator,211.314,212.18,Do you think she's good?
SPEAKER_00,213.502,249.395," Yes, I do I think she's emotionally guarded I  Think she'll speak to that later in the session  You know so it says I think there have been  injuries  Some of which I'm gonna guess really are related to the the race pieces that she's  Experienced where she has felt judged under scrutiny, and it just keeps repeating herself, and it's separate from comportment  Accomplishments and so there is a guardedness and there is a sensitivity and the guardedness is her way  I think of protecting some of her vulnerability okay."
