SPEAKER_01," Um, I mean, I've been journaling, like you said.",27.161,32.679
SPEAKER_00," Good, good.",33.222,33.889
SPEAKER_01," Um, I've spent time helping.",36.228,37.517
SPEAKER_01," Uh, I feel like there's still a lot of room for improvement though.",38.782,44.92
SPEAKER_01, But it has improved slightly.,45.584,47.477
SPEAKER_00," So, when you said you've been journaling, were you able to, when you had a negative thought,  or you know, a situation occurred where you had a negative thought, were you writing down a negative thought?",48.582,57.916
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, um, not automatic.",59.081,60.939
SPEAKER_01," Well, I was thinking what you told me.",61.343,62.939

SPEAKER_00, And you were able to make it a positive thought?,64.242,66.779
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I mean, I tried, um, to do that.",67.803,71.94
SPEAKER_01," It helped some, but, uh, I guess any improvement's better.",73.023,79.719
SPEAKER_01," But, uh, I think maybe just to keep doing it, maybe it'll get better.",80.582,84.92
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,85.224,85.694
SPEAKER_01, But I was more aware of how things are occurring.,86.101,89.0

SPEAKER_01," Um, a little bit.",99.487,101.457
SPEAKER_01," Um, not exactly.",102.121,104.0
SPEAKER_01, But I just remember how my thoughts.,104.723,108.779
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,109.714,109.837
SPEAKER_01, Are causing things.,110.061,110.98
SPEAKER_00, So would you come out to our view before we actually get into this session?,111.584,114.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,114.612,114.898
SPEAKER_00, Would that be okay?,115.061,115.98
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,116.51,116.918
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,117.0,117.143
SPEAKER_00," So how it goes is like, say a situation or an event happens, you have a thought, okay?",118.0,122.779
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,123.061,123.51
SPEAKER_00," And like I know last time it was your lack of confidence, and it could be like, I'm not  good enough, and that was your thought process last time, correct?",124.121,130.96
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,131.163,131.367
SPEAKER_00," And then so when you have a thought, you have an emotion.",132.0,133.96
SPEAKER_00, Last time you were saying how it made you feel bad about yourself.,135.081,137.638
SPEAKER_00, You felt incompetent.,138.02,139.0
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,139.245,139.735
SPEAKER_00," And then your behavior is you were, you know, you lashed out at others and you were mean.",140.04,143.454
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,145.102,145.898
SPEAKER_00, So do you feel like that you kind of understand that?,146.0,148.834
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,150.327,150.469
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,151.286,151.469
SPEAKER_00," So I know last time, like I said, we talked about your lack of confidence.",152.0,154.01
SPEAKER_00," So for today, I know you mentioned that you also were having problems with using marijuana  and depression, you had problems with depression, and you also had anger issues.",156.0,167.0
SPEAKER_00," And out of those, which one do you think you'd like to discuss today?",167.181,171.116
SPEAKER_01, Probably the anger issues.,172.141,173.838
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,174.02,174.122
SPEAKER_01, I feel like that's the biggest problem going on right now.,175.482,178.779
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,179.245,179.918
SPEAKER_00, Tell me a little bit more about your anger issues.,180.785,182.275
SPEAKER_01," I mean, it's not like I'm just like an angry person.",183.443,185.98
SPEAKER_01, It just like snaps at anybody.,186.444,187.939
SPEAKER_01," But I get defensive, I guess.",188.0,191.474
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,193.286,193.469
SPEAKER_01, I'm very defensive.,194.02,195.0
SPEAKER_01, And then I usually want to lash out.,195.262,197.718
SPEAKER_01," But I've never, I've lashed out at my child, you know, my son or anything.",199.024,203.0
SPEAKER_01, It's usually always my husband.,203.283,204.98
SPEAKER_00, Can you tell me about the last time you lashed out at your husband?,205.502,207.651
SPEAKER_01, We were unloading the groceries.,210.505,211.939
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,212.694,212.878
SPEAKER_01, And I actually had just had my hair done and cut and colored and everything.,213.261,219.117
SPEAKER_01," And I was so excited because I thought he was going to love it, you know.",220.06,222.758
SPEAKER_01," And he looked at it and he, of course, he thought, well, how much money did it cost?",223.482,228.037
SPEAKER_01," And, you know, girl, you know, these things are kind of expensive.",229.221,231.94
SPEAKER_00, Right.,232.102,232.327
SPEAKER_01," And so I told him, you know, it would have been $60.",233.564,235.054
SPEAKER_01," And he told me that, you know, we've been struggling with money lately a little bit.",236.762,242.358
SPEAKER_01, And that I didn't need to spend that much money and that I was selfish.,243.241,248.659
SPEAKER_01, And then I hit him.,249.905,252.518
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,253.51,253.796
SPEAKER_00," So now what I'm writing down here is kind of like what we talked about, how there's an event or a situation.",254.261,258.578
SPEAKER_00, You have a thought and you have an emotion.,259.342,261.497
SPEAKER_00," I know like with what you were just saying, the event or the situation was that you got your hair done.",262.0,268.077
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,269.0,269.469
SPEAKER_00, And that he was angry about that.,270.04,271.576
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,272.041,272.224
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,273.306,273.735
SPEAKER_01," He was just, yeah, he was just saying mean things.",274.201,277.075
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,278.04,278.141
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,280.261,284.9
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,285.0,285.98
SPEAKER_00," Now, what did you, in that moment when he was being mean, what was, not how you felt, but what was your actual thought?",286.301,294.297
SPEAKER_00, Like when he was saying all that stuff and?,296.04,297.785
SPEAKER_01, I'm selfish.,303.242,303.828
SPEAKER_00, You thought I'm selfish.,305.02,305.959
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,306.02,306.714
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,307.04,308.752
SPEAKER_01," Initially, yeah, that was it.",310.121,312.0
SPEAKER_01, He's right.,312.0,312.286
SPEAKER_01, I believe that was selfish.,313.182,314.152
SPEAKER_00, How did that make you feel when you actually thought I'm selfish?,315.442,318.216
SPEAKER_01, Guilty.,319.02,319.388
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,320.224,320.449
SPEAKER_00, So you felt guilty?,321.0,321.469
SPEAKER_01, Sad.,322.261,322.724
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,326.449,326.898
SPEAKER_01, And then angry.,327.0,327.49
SPEAKER_00, Angry.,328.224,328.449
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,329.02,329.347
SPEAKER_01, Very angry.,330.02,331.0
SPEAKER_01, But he made me feel that way.,331.747,332.798
SPEAKER_01, I wasn't feeling that way before he said that.,333.0,334.818
SPEAKER_01," And then once he said that, you know, he put that thought in my head and it made me angry.",335.301,342.376
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,344.633,344.837
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,345.184,345.347
SPEAKER_00," So when he was getting mad at you and then telling you you're selfish and you felt selfish  or you thought to yourself, I'm selfish, and then you got angry, what did you do after you got angry?",346.281,359.619
SPEAKER_01, I smacked him.,361.01,361.717
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,362.612,362.857
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,363.776,363.959
SPEAKER_01, Yep.,364.49,364.735
SPEAKER_00, So there was physical contact there.,365.061,367.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,367.0,367.204
SPEAKER_01, I hit him upside his head.,368.788,369.798
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,370.041,370.224
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I felt that afterwards.",372.97,374.0
SPEAKER_01, Me too.,374.327,374.776
SPEAKER_01, It's just I was so mad.,375.0,375.918
SPEAKER_00, Right.,376.0,376.204
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,377.245,377.755
SPEAKER_01, How do you feel that way?,378.0,378.837
SPEAKER_00, Uh-huh.,379.0,379.367
SPEAKER_01," I just, I lashed out.",380.04,381.309
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,383.909,384.111
SPEAKER_00," So when he has these, when he kind of gets upset at you for certain things like this,  how do you think you could change from you smacking him to having a more calm and positive response?",386.182,403.198
SPEAKER_01," Well, I think if I was able to get his angry.",405.327,407.658
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,408.388,408.959
SPEAKER_00, How do you think you might be able to do that?,409.04,410.188
SPEAKER_00, Like this is how we would do it.,414.291,415.578
SPEAKER_00," With CBT, we would change your thought.",416.141,417.852
SPEAKER_00," So when he gets upset with you and calls you selfish, you start to feel selfish.",419.02,425.719
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,426.469,426.673
SPEAKER_00, So how could you not feel selfish?,427.0,428.939
SPEAKER_00, Do you think you could change your thought?,429.0,430.893
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,432.776,432.939
SPEAKER_01," I mean, if I never even thought that I was selfish, then I wouldn't be getting angry.",433.221,437.779
SPEAKER_00, So do you think you're selfish?,438.785,439.711
SPEAKER_01," I mean, at the time I did that and I felt like awful.",442.905,446.0
SPEAKER_01," But now, like, he says that we're hurting for money, but we're really not.",446.803,451.92
SPEAKER_01," Like, we're able to pay our bills.",452.143,453.0
SPEAKER_01, We're able to do things.,453.02,454.556
SPEAKER_01," I mean, he's just kind of like a cheap person.",455.0,457.0
SPEAKER_01," But we have plenty of money to, we're not hurting at all.",457.924,461.558
SPEAKER_01," And with my self-confidence, I don't think it was selfish in one.",462.562,467.0
SPEAKER_01," Make myself feel prettier, you know?",467.745,469.336
SPEAKER_01, But I think people do other selfish tendencies like that.,471.627,474.92
SPEAKER_00, So what I'm hearing you say is you don't think you're selfish at all.,476.047,477.98
SPEAKER_01," Well, I mean, I'm selfish.",478.886,480.799
SPEAKER_00," But in this situation, you don't think you're being selfish.",481.162,482.919
SPEAKER_01, I don't think I'm just wrong.,483.082,483.898
SPEAKER_01, I really don't.,484.826,485.832
SPEAKER_01," Now, if I had gone by a whole new wardrobe, nothing else, none along with it, but I mean, I just did my hair.",488.003,492.96
SPEAKER_01, And he's a real estate agent.,494.602,499.779
SPEAKER_01," He had sold a big house that week, so we had enough money for me to afford it.",500.723,504.98
SPEAKER_00, Right.,505.102,505.347
SPEAKER_01, So he's just a pain in the juice sometimes.,506.02,509.839
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,510.202,511.414
SPEAKER_00," So instead of thinking I'm selfish, what could you actually think?",512.262,514.376
SPEAKER_01, That I deserve to spend money on myself.,520.364,521.98
SPEAKER_01, I don't want to spend money on me sometimes.,522.0,523.455
SPEAKER_00, I deserve this.,524.424,525.111
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,526.0,526.141
SPEAKER_00," I mean, who doesn't deserve something every now and then, right?",529.262,531.577
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,532.0,532.163
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so if you were thinking I deserve this, if that was your thought when he was getting in, if you thought, no, I deserve this, how do you think that would actually make you feel?",533.08,540.779
SPEAKER_00, What kind of emotion would you feel at that point?,541.401,543.147
SPEAKER_00, Would that make you feel confident?,547.081,548.212
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, confident in my decision.",549.182,550.919
SPEAKER_00, Right.,551.551,551.878
SPEAKER_01," I would still feel a little sad that he thought that, but I don't think it would be to the level that it was when I thought I was selfish.",555.705,566.68
SPEAKER_00," So if you felt confident about your decision because you actually changed your thought, do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you actually getting angry, you would think there's no need for this?",567.18,578.519
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I think it would help me realize that that's his issue and I won't.",579.462,582.759
SPEAKER_00, Right.,583.286,583.612
SPEAKER_00, So how do you think you would actually behave then?,584.02,585.455
SPEAKER_01, Walk off.,586.889,587.394
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,588.102,588.388
SPEAKER_01," Or even be able to, this is kind of what I wanted to get to as well, be able to express it in a non-violent manner.",590.042,599.98
SPEAKER_01, Because he didn't deserve for me to hit on him.,600.564,602.879
SPEAKER_01," I mean, he didn't.",603.245,604.0
SPEAKER_01," He said something that upset me, but no one deserves that.",604.723,608.92
SPEAKER_01, Someone's hand is put on him.,609.04,610.434
SPEAKER_00, Right.,611.02,611.245
SPEAKER_00," So maybe instead of thinking also that you're selfish when he's getting my back, do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead that maybe he just doesn't understand and maybe I need to tell him that I do deserve this and explain it to him that this makes me feel good about myself?",612.821,628.98
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, I could try that.",629.121,630.717
SPEAKER_00," Because you know, you know you're not selfish.",631.0,632.96
SPEAKER_00, It's just something that makes you feel good.,633.02,634.919
SPEAKER_01, And I think also he understood why I did it.,635.341,638.876
SPEAKER_01," Because I mean, he knows that I have some self-conscious issues, but I don't think he realizes how bad it was or why I got my hair cut.",640.441,647.0
SPEAKER_01, I think he's seen it as just the most girly things.,647.141,649.94
SPEAKER_01," He didn't realize that it made me feel better about myself, you know?",650.04,652.718
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,653.367,653.98
SPEAKER_01, So that might help as well.,654.0,655.778
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,656.102,656.286
SPEAKER_01, Which goes back to his presidencies.,658.444,659.798
SPEAKER_00, Right.,660.878,661.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,661.041,661.163
SPEAKER_00, So do you think in like the next coming week that you could actually change your thoughts?,664.066,669.0
SPEAKER_00, In turn to change how you feel?,671.07,672.899
SPEAKER_01," I could try, yeah.",673.646,674.495
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,675.061,675.49
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,676.041,676.143
SPEAKER_00," Since we talked about your anger issues, I know you were saying last time that you were also having problems with depression.",677.722,684.88
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,685.653,685.939
SPEAKER_00, And you were also having problems with your marijuana use.,686.744,689.96
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,690.082,690.204
SPEAKER_00," And either one of those, would you like to discuss that?",691.361,695.197
SPEAKER_00," Or I mean, would you like to discuss your anger issues further?",698.828,701.295
SPEAKER_01," No, we can talk about the depression.",703.667,705.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,705.061,705.143
SPEAKER_00, What do you think triggers your depression?,707.591,708.96
SPEAKER_00, What makes you depressed?,709.909,710.879
SPEAKER_01," Well, my son kind of at the age where he doesn't want me to be involved in his life.",713.143,720.519
SPEAKER_01, And I've kind of always been the housewife.,722.084,725.9
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,726.224,726.347
SPEAKER_01," And he's at, and he's always been my wife, you know?",728.143,734.0
SPEAKER_01, I did everything with him.,734.102,734.959
SPEAKER_01, I went to all his practices with him.,735.04,736.737
SPEAKER_01, And he's mommy's little boy.,737.061,738.535
SPEAKER_01, But he's not mommy's little boy anymore.,739.0,740.616
SPEAKER_01, And so now he's kind of growing up and doing his own thing.,741.624,743.899
SPEAKER_01, And then I'm kind of left alone.,744.282,746.295
SPEAKER_00, How old is your son?,747.384,748.192
SPEAKER_01, He's 14.,749.347,749.653
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,750.0,750.265
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,751.51,751.837
SPEAKER_00, That's an interesting age.,752.485,753.596
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,754.265,754.469
SPEAKER_01," And so he's kind of telling me there's any little man who he'll tell him I said that, he'd probably have been there.",755.542,759.98
SPEAKER_01," But, and like, and I don't know if that's where it comes from, but I know that that's here lately.",760.401,767.158
SPEAKER_01," You know, I'm used to him being at home, and now I'm staying with friends, and I'm home by myself a lot.",768.141,772.859
SPEAKER_01," Or he doesn't like for me to call him, or no more kisses, and you know.",773.682,779.659
SPEAKER_01," And I know that it's normal, but it still makes me feel really depressed.",780.622,784.498
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,785.286,785.592
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,786.0,786.224
SPEAKER_00," So, the situation here is that your son doesn't want to be involved with you as much.",787.0,791.88
SPEAKER_00, Do you feel like that's accurate?,792.283,793.596
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,794.714,794.939
SPEAKER_01, And then he's just growing up.,795.424,796.778
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,797.102,797.245
SPEAKER_00," And what do you think to yourself when he doesn't want to talk to mom anymore, and he doesn't want to be mom's little boy, and he's out doing his own thing?",798.281,805.817
SPEAKER_01," Well, I mean like, this week I was taking on his football schedule.",807.08,815.399
SPEAKER_01, He's a big football player.,816.222,817.232
SPEAKER_01," You wouldn't believe it, but a big old boy came out of me.",818.02,819.434
SPEAKER_01," And, there you go boy.",820.644,822.034
