SPEAKER_00,14.218,15.239," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."
SPEAKER_00,15.68,17.234, I hope you find this video useful.
SPEAKER_00,18.0,20.956," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_00,21.8,23.145," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,27.2,29.253, Let's say you go into a house.
SPEAKER_00,30.4,31.188, Do you go into the community?
SPEAKER_00,32.4,37.776, Do you go into a house and have an off day?
SPEAKER_00,39.3,44.315," Maybe worried about making mistakes, maybe stressed about that, maybe tired."
SPEAKER_00,46.04,53.857," And there's some evidence there that you should be able to pick up, but you just don't."
SPEAKER_00,55.361,65.495," Somebody lies to you about what the conditions there are,  and you kind of realize that they might not be telling the truth, but you're ready to get home."
SPEAKER_00,67.56,69.386, So you leave and then somebody's hurt.
SPEAKER_00,69.406,70.75,Would that be kind of a worst case?
SPEAKER_00,74.041,75.792, That's the type of mistake you're afraid of making.
SPEAKER_00,77.142,78.638, What would that feel like to make that mistake?
SPEAKER_01,78.8,79.401, It would feel terrible.
SPEAKER_01,79.461,87.259,"It would feel like, you know, I had a role in that kind of thing happening to somebody."
SPEAKER_01,87.8,92.656," Like, it was... I'm partially to blame for somebody being harmed."
SPEAKER_01,94.041,97.249, And that is like the exact opposite of what my job is supposed to be.
SPEAKER_00,101.8,107.113," If there were to be a worst case outcome, you would be extremely upset."
SPEAKER_00,110.261,111.383, You're extremely upset now.
SPEAKER_00,111.483,115.43,"Well, you're a 5 out of 10 right now, but you're an 8 when you're in bed in the morning."
SPEAKER_00,121.101,125.195, Is it reasonable that a professional makes a mistake like that?
SPEAKER_00,126.8,130.096, This is a mistake of kind of missing something that normally would be caught.
SPEAKER_00,130.8,135.198, Is it reasonable that they continue on in the field and try to learn from that?
SPEAKER_01,136.462,136.903, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,136.943,137.224,I mean...
SPEAKER_01,143.061,148.8," I'd like to think that... I guess it's not possible to make that kind of mistake, but I think that that's naive."
SPEAKER_01,149.181,150.323, I think it is possible.
SPEAKER_01,150.343,158.7,"And I would like to learn from that, but I don't know what other people would do."
SPEAKER_01,159.363,161.574," Like, I don't know if I would lose my job or anything."
SPEAKER_00,163.142,165.715," Right, there might be consequences for that type of error."
SPEAKER_00,167.421,169.926, It's not intentional.
SPEAKER_00,171.028,176.8,"Something that, like many mistakes, would happen due to a confluence of circumstances."
SPEAKER_00,176.9,180.274," You being tired, it being the end of the day, them not being honest."
SPEAKER_00,181.178,181.8,There's mitigation there.
SPEAKER_00,182.664,184.936," But still, I can appreciate you wouldn't want to make that mistake either way."
SPEAKER_00,187.963,191.694," After making a mistake like that, what would your thought be?"
SPEAKER_00,191.714,193.158,What would you be thinking?
SPEAKER_01,194.081,197.137," I would be thinking, I don't know how this will ever be better."
SPEAKER_01,198.001,200.569, I don't know how I'm ever going to feel okay about what I did.
SPEAKER_00,203.921,206.76," So by extension, I'll never feel okay about what I did."
SPEAKER_01,207.041,207.202, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,211.642,216.594, And what do you think you would do then in terms of your reaction to that thought?
SPEAKER_01,219.601,220.122, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,220.142,232.958,"I mean, I guess ideally I would say to myself it's going to get better, and this will pass and everything, but I don't know."
SPEAKER_01,233.038,233.799,It's just hard.
SPEAKER_00,235.664,237.252, What do you think it would do to your work performance?
SPEAKER_01,239.201,241.087, I think I would probably have to take some time off.
SPEAKER_01,241.147,243.955,"I mean, it's just like I would be so stressed afterwards."
SPEAKER_01,245.8,250.092, I'm worried I would make another mistake because I'm so stressed out and having trouble focusing.
SPEAKER_00,253.201,262.379," So, in a strange way, the anxiety, the thoughts you're having now, and the resulting anxiety are leaving you more at risk to make a mistake."
SPEAKER_01,263.442,263.743, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,264.466,267.917,"I mean, I guess I never thought about it like that, although that makes a lot of sense."
SPEAKER_01,268.94,279.56," Like, if I just calm down and try to let it go, then I'll do my job better and I won't have that risk as much."
SPEAKER_01,279.8,287.617," But if I keep feeling like this, I'm not focusing, and then I could make a bigger mistake because of it."
SPEAKER_00,289.381,289.602, Right.
SPEAKER_00,289.622,297.197,"So, one of the thoughts you're having now is, I can't make a mistake because it would be too devastating."
SPEAKER_00,299.684,302.78, And that type... Is that kind of a thought that you're having?
SPEAKER_01,302.8,302.902, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,303.88,305.442," So, it's like, I can't make a mistake."
SPEAKER_00,306.123,316.899,"And this is leaving you emotionally less prepared, and probably increased risk of making a mistake."
