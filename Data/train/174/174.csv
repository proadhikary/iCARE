SPEAKER_00," Hi, how are you doing today?",0.0,0.521
SPEAKER_01, I'm okay.,14.495,14.856
SPEAKER_01,"How are you, Dr. Grande?",14.896,16.8
SPEAKER_00, Not bad.,17.862,18.203
SPEAKER_00,Thanks for asking.,18.223,18.925
SPEAKER_00,What's been going on?,19.527,20.008
SPEAKER_01, There's not really a lot of change on the drug front.,24.4,30.532
SPEAKER_01," You know, the Adderall, I'm really struggling.",34.721,40.896
SPEAKER_00, Still struggling with the Adderall?,42.4,43.349
SPEAKER_01," I'm not sure what to do because I know that, I mean, I'm having such a hard time with it, but when I don't have it, I'm just not functioning.",48.604,57.873
SPEAKER_01,I'm not able to get as much accomplished.,58.054,61.117
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so, go ahead.",65.487,67.098
SPEAKER_01," Well, it's like it's always there too.",67.44,69.152
SPEAKER_00, It's always available to you.,70.522,71.359
SPEAKER_01," It's always available, yeah, or so much of the time.",71.42,74.616
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so you're having some mixed feelings about it though, I'm sensing.",75.681,78.254
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, like I know I want to stop, I think.",80.223,84.658
SPEAKER_00, You think you want to stop?,85.905,86.612
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, no, I do.",87.4,88.572
SPEAKER_00, You do?,89.4,90.38
SPEAKER_01," Oh my God, see, I feel crazy, but I know it would be good if I didn't have it in my life.",90.941,97.112
SPEAKER_00," But at the same time, it is in your life.",101.702,103.132
SPEAKER_01, And I don't know how to get out of that.,104.782,106.37
SPEAKER_01," I mean, the one thing, if I didn't live with my roommate, that would be one thing.",108.52,114.758
SPEAKER_01, I wouldn't be in the apartment all the time.,116.104,117.852
SPEAKER_00," So, you find you have easier access to the Adderall when you're in the house or apartment with your roommate?",120.162,128.719
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,129.562,129.804
SPEAKER_00," So, if you physically weren't there, like with your roommate in that apartment?",132.122,136.938
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, like if I was, oh my God, living at home with my parents again, or even living with somebody else, I guess.",138.282,145.117
SPEAKER_01," Oh my God, to move!",147.144,148.953
SPEAKER_01," What a hassle, but that's, I mean, that's the problem.",150.782,152.892
SPEAKER_01,It's just there.,153.134,153.958
SPEAKER_01, It's accessible.,155.606,156.712
SPEAKER_00," So, you're kind of, it sounds like you're recognizing that maybe you don't have the willpower to stop taking the drug when it's right there in front of you.",159.5,170.396
SPEAKER_01, Maybe you're right.,173.56,174.262
SPEAKER_01, That's good.,183.741,184.282
SPEAKER_01,Because before I didn't really want to stop.,185.806,189.375
SPEAKER_01, And sometimes I want to stop.,192.283,194.95
SPEAKER_01,My mind will go back and forth.,195.752,196.976
SPEAKER_01," But for the most part, I would like to be without it.",199.503,203.655
SPEAKER_01, I really don't want to deal with this anymore.,206.387,208.078
SPEAKER_00," So, mostly, so there's still some feelings where you want to use it, but mostly you would like to stop.",209.222,216.36
SPEAKER_01," Well, it makes it so easy to get stuff done.",216.941,220.169
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, I just take a couple and boom, boom, boom.",220.189,223.698
SPEAKER_01,I mean.,223.798,223.999
SPEAKER_00," So, there's some advantages for you.",225.329,226.4
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, definitely.",227.302,228.524
SPEAKER_01,Definitely.,229.266,229.667
SPEAKER_01,"And I'm so used to it, too.",229.687,231.17
SPEAKER_01,It's just comfortable.,231.23,232.131
SPEAKER_00, It's comfortable and it allows you to be productive.,237.122,240.931
SPEAKER_00,Are there any downsides to it?,241.974,243.237
SPEAKER_01," Well, yeah.",245.081,246.404
SPEAKER_01,"When I don't have it, the crash, it's like a really bad crash.",247.786,251.132
SPEAKER_01,I'm not productive.,253.957,254.999
SPEAKER_01," You know, it's, and it's gotten worse than it used to be.",255.801,260.296
SPEAKER_00," So, it's painful.",261.767,262.318
SPEAKER_01," Like, I need it.",262.901,263.622
SPEAKER_01,It's painful.,263.642,264.404
SPEAKER_01,Definitely.,264.464,265.045
SPEAKER_01,Definitely.,265.766,266.347
SPEAKER_01,It feels like a trap.,266.928,267.93
SPEAKER_01,And I want out.,269.653,270.374
SPEAKER_00," And one of the ideas you were having was, it sounded like potentially, was moving out.",273.882,278.999
SPEAKER_00, Moving out of the apartment.,279.741,280.683
SPEAKER_00,"Because then you wouldn't have access to the, you wouldn't have access to the Adderall anymore.",281.706,286.377
SPEAKER_00, Or it would be harder to get.,288.064,289.172
SPEAKER_01, Oh my God.,290.661,291.563
SPEAKER_01,"Like, sometimes it's really weird.",291.644,293.709
SPEAKER_01,"Sometimes it feels like that's a good idea and then sometimes I'm like, no, no.",293.75,297.039
SPEAKER_01," I don't want to be, you know, kind of cut off from it.",297.761,302.012
SPEAKER_01,"But, I think I'm ready.",302.152,305.4
SPEAKER_00, You think you're ready for that?,306.026,306.915
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,307.44,307.824
SPEAKER_00," And that moving out, you really see is what you would need to do.",310.001,313.81
SPEAKER_00,Because stopping while living there is too difficult.,314.592,318.3
SPEAKER_01, Oh my God.,318.52,319.243
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,321.872,322.153
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, I think you're right.",323.156,324.059
SPEAKER_00," I remember before you've tried to stop while living there a few times, right?",325.222,329.274
SPEAKER_00,Or the last few months.,329.314,330.818
SPEAKER_00," And with your roommate having it, with your roommate being the one that gives it to you, it just appears the temptation is so great for you.",331.841,339.059
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, she really doesn't get it.",340.282,341.665
SPEAKER_01,"She doesn't understand, like, what a problem this is for me.",341.845,347.939
SPEAKER_01, She's definitely not supporting me or anything like that.,349.664,352.835
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,355.344,355.705
SPEAKER_01,"God, maybe it would be better.",357.071,358.496
SPEAKER_00," Well, are there any disadvantages to living with your parents?",360.806,364.099
SPEAKER_01," Living with my parents at my age, it just feels like a little bit humiliating, a lot humiliating.",368.088,372.4
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so humiliation would be one?",373.026,374.38
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, and just this feeling of failure, embarrassment.",374.881,379.088
SPEAKER_01,"And then my mom just is in my business, you know.",380.13,385.438
SPEAKER_00, So there's some clear disadvantages to moving into parents.,387.721,390.166
SPEAKER_00,"Any advantages other than the obvious, it would sever you from the adderall?",390.347,396.2
SPEAKER_01," My mom would do my laundry, fully stocked fridge.",397.141,400.525
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,400.986,403.148
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, my dad will fill my gas tank up.",407.654,412.22
SPEAKER_00, Are these things that happened before when you used to live there?,415.666,417.672
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, yeah, not so bad.",417.813,419.357
SPEAKER_00," So there's some disadvantages to this plan, but there's some advantages and there's a key advantage of being cut off from the adderall.",421.121,430.32
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, and it wouldn't necessarily have to be the rest of my life either.",430.56,437.059
SPEAKER_00, Hmm.,437.624,437.849
SPEAKER_01," Just for now, just to get me out of that apartment with the drug, right?",439.423,446.119
SPEAKER_00, That would separate you from the drug and you could potentially move out later on.,448.243,452.38
SPEAKER_01," Oh my God, do I want to?",452.921,454.465
SPEAKER_01,"I mean, that's just it.",454.545,455.988
SPEAKER_01,It sounds really good until I really think about it.,458.634,461.26
SPEAKER_00," So when you really think about it, what comes to mind?",462.566,465.219
SPEAKER_01," Oh, like I start to shake, like that feeling of, you know, when you really want something, you really want something and you can't get to it.",466.402,474.38
SPEAKER_01," And it's just that desperation that, and like right now, I know that I'm living there, it could be my choice.",475.221,487.24
SPEAKER_01," I could take it or I could not take it, you know, but at least when I want it, it's there.",487.842,492.159
SPEAKER_01," If I move out, I'm like making that decision for myself.",493.144,496.34
SPEAKER_00," That's right, you would be.",497.188,498.137
SPEAKER_01, I don't know.,499.541,504.36
SPEAKER_00, Is this tough?,504.764,505.309
SPEAKER_00," Well, before it seemed like you were really more on the side of making this change than not.",508.063,515.879
SPEAKER_00, But clearly there's still some things you want to consider.,517.546,520.4
SPEAKER_01," No, you know, you're right though.",521.662,523.304
SPEAKER_01,I want out.,523.324,525.807
SPEAKER_01,And it's not really a choice when I'm there.,528.21,532.316
SPEAKER_01,"Like I say I have the choice, yes or no, but the choice is always yes.",532.416,535.36
SPEAKER_00, You always end up using the Adderall.,535.4,537.4
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,537.4,537.482
SPEAKER_00," So, let me make sure I understand the situation overall.",541.763,545.068
SPEAKER_00,"You live with your roommate, she has Adderall, when she makes it available to you, you use it.",546.49,553.4
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,553.4,553.686
SPEAKER_00," You've tried to stop that behavior, but that's just not working for you.",556.205,561.4
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, that's so clear.",561.842,563.511
SPEAKER_01,And I don't want to be using it.,563.531,565.4
SPEAKER_00," You don't want to be using it, but yet you are, especially because the proximity.",566.62,573.933
SPEAKER_00,Because you're right there and she has it and it's just tough for you to stop that behavior.,574.433,578.34
SPEAKER_00," There's another possible decision, which is moving back home, which has some disadvantages and advantages.",579.704,585.36
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's true.",585.52,586.524
SPEAKER_01,"God, it would be nice having that fully stocked fridge.",586.544,590.918
SPEAKER_00," So, there's an upside to it that would be beyond just not using the drug, which in itself would be a big victory for you.",592.46,601.079
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, and my mom would be there to talk to, yeah.",602.183,605.514
SPEAKER_00," So, let's do this.",608.424,609.127
SPEAKER_00,"It seems like that's the direction you're moving, right?",609.207,611.637
SPEAKER_01," Okay, yeah.",612.645,613.216
SPEAKER_00," No pun intended with the word moving, but you're thinking that might be a better way to go.",613.4,620.26
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,620.788,620.992
SPEAKER_00," So, for the next session, let's plan out, and this wouldn't necessarily be doing anything, let's plan out the steps that you'd have to put in place to move back home.",622.362,632.859
SPEAKER_00," Talking to your parents, whatever financial arrangement you have with your roommate, getting all your stuff out, the logistics of moving, let's just go through the steps.",634.282,642.32
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,642.931,643.155
SPEAKER_00, And try to get a firm plan together.,643.721,646.31
SPEAKER_00,And of course you can always reevaluate and change your mind.,646.33,649.059
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,649.563,649.829
SPEAKER_00," Right, but all we're doing at this point is just planning and seeing how it would look.",650.4,653.918
SPEAKER_01, This is kind of exciting.,654.665,655.359
SPEAKER_00, Is it exciting?,655.482,656.196
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it definitely is.",656.44,657.673
SPEAKER_01,I can do that.,657.814,658.4
SPEAKER_00, Good.,658.4,658.543
SPEAKER_00," So, I will see you next week.",660.184,663.4
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,664.033,664.278
SPEAKER_00," And we'll pick up right where we left off, and we'll start with the planning, and we'll see what happens with that.",664.741,670.4
SPEAKER_01, Cool.,670.788,670.91
SPEAKER_01,All right.,670.931,671.4
SPEAKER_00, All right.,671.482,671.931
SPEAKER_00,"Thanks, Anne.",672.094,672.4
SPEAKER_01, Sure.,672.543,672.665
