SPEAKER_00,1.691,2.758," All right, Liz, how are you?"
SPEAKER_01,3.429,3.653, Good.
SPEAKER_00,4.02,5.248," Good, it's good to see you."
SPEAKER_00,7.06,21.047," I was just looking at your, the binge record that we've been keeping weekly and I noticed  that last week you were at five kind of episodes of binge eating and this week you were down  to three."
SPEAKER_01,21.843,22.129, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,22.7,24.099," Yeah, so awesome."
SPEAKER_00,24.18,27.638," So what, help me understand what's been going on this week."
SPEAKER_00,28.12,29.033, What was involved with the change?
SPEAKER_01,30.483,32.878," Yeah, I mean, good week with the roommate."
SPEAKER_01,33.541,46.019, I had a good conversation with her about like what times are good for boyfriend to be over  and kind of giving her better heads up on when I really need silence.
SPEAKER_00,46.402,47.919," Well, terrific."
SPEAKER_00,48.0,54.358," So what was, what specifically, I mean, I know we've talked a lot about that, but what  specifically did you say to her or how did you bring it up?"
SPEAKER_01,54.68,73.86," I was just telling her that like my studies are really important and I understand like  it's also important that she has time with her boyfriend, but that I would really appreciate  that this is both our space and that there are times when like we really need to respect  each other's space and yeah, she responded really well."
SPEAKER_01,74.201,77.993," She was like, just really give me a good heads up before you, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,80.24,86.752, And that we kind of decided like certain times are more appropriate for them to have the  living room and not.
SPEAKER_00,87.84,88.758," Right, right."
SPEAKER_00,89.043,90.34," Yeah, because I think that's really similar."
SPEAKER_00,90.541,113.679," I know we kind of talked about that and as I, you know, you remember like a few sessions  ago, I was kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in terms of what you were  feeling because it seems like one of the ways that you've, you know, we talked about that  before in terms of like, you know, when we were first starting that oftentimes one of  the ways that you manage your feelings is you kind of, you think you are letting people  know what you're feeling, but it doesn't really come out."
SPEAKER_00,114.102,125.197," And I know that it was something that you and I had to really like, you know, kind of  work out, but it sounds like that you were able to talk with her and that she heard you  and as I kind of thought that she was actually really responsive in a very positive way."
SPEAKER_01,125.84,129.28,I think being a little more direct was helpful.
SPEAKER_00,129.524,130.259, It's really nice.
SPEAKER_00,130.34,130.912, It's really nice.
SPEAKER_00,131.32,136.32," Well, I think too, you've been able to do that more with me and I feel like that, I  feel like that's been really helpful."
SPEAKER_00,136.542,143.051," I know they've been kind of pushing you on that and that's been hard, but I feel like  it's been really nice because I feel like it's really been helpful with your relationship  with Kathy."
SPEAKER_00,143.54,144.377, So that's fantastic.
SPEAKER_00,144.56,159.46," And also, you know, again, I know that I've keep, you know, like saying this over and  over again, but you know, as you've worked on these things, it's been really notable  that it's really had a nice and positive effect on your eating because it seems like it's  really, you've really seen a lot of real nice improvements."
SPEAKER_00,159.52,160.214, So awesome.
SPEAKER_00,162.006,165.896," Anything else that, you know, so you had a really good conversation with Kathy, anything  else going on this week?"
SPEAKER_01,166.1,167.979," Yeah, I got to spend some time with Brooke."
SPEAKER_00,168.222,168.937, Oh nice.
SPEAKER_01,169.682,174.097, I went home for two days and was with my mom and Brooke.
SPEAKER_00,174.98,175.143, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,175.98,178.92, So is she still six or did she have a birthday recently?
SPEAKER_01,179.244,180.198, She's almost seven.
SPEAKER_00,180.968,181.656," Oh, that's great."
SPEAKER_00,182.102,182.694, Almost seven.
SPEAKER_00,183.123,183.266, Great.
SPEAKER_00,183.98,185.98, Any plans for birthday for her or what do you think she's going to do?
SPEAKER_01,186.041,187.738, She's really into frozen.
SPEAKER_00,188.409,188.511, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,189.021,189.919, Anything frozen is good.
SPEAKER_01,189.98,190.674, Anything frozen is good.
SPEAKER_00,190.98,191.245, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,192.041,192.49, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,193.0,193.164, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,193.98,194.082, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,194.98,195.102, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,196.0,196.633, That sounds terrific.
SPEAKER_00,196.98,197.98, And so then you spent some time with her.
SPEAKER_00,198.86,199.86, I'm going to ask you a little bit more about your mom and how that felt positive for you.
SPEAKER_00,199.86,205.537," Did you, when you were there, did you have any opportunity to visit with your mom or  how did that go?"
SPEAKER_01,205.7,206.7, I feel like my mom was around.
SPEAKER_01,206.7,214.579, Like we kind of all spent time together and like she asked about school and I was able  to like tell her a little more about school and how things are going.
SPEAKER_01,214.7,214.924, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,216.283,218.356, We didn't really get like one on one time.
SPEAKER_00,219.06,230.119," How did that feel for you in terms of like, you know, for her, I know that you talked  about not really liking that she all of a sudden is deciding now that she wants to really  be kind of like, you know, the good mother and kind of like be involved in your life."
SPEAKER_00,230.3,233.719, But how is it for her to kind of like want to know how things have been going for you?
SPEAKER_01,234.08,240.797," I mean, I've kind of like allowed myself to tell her, I guess, how things have been going."
SPEAKER_01,242.803,249.632," But I mean, like to an extent, like it was like with Brooke and whatnot, like we didn't  really sit down just us two together."
SPEAKER_00,250.86,260.158," So kind of what we had discussed kind of that you've been, you've like, you've been allowing  yourself to be more connected with her, but you're still kind of keeping up, keeping a  little bit of a boundary."
SPEAKER_00,260.281,260.526, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,261.464,261.607, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,262.26,272.32," Well, I'm sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything that's gone on,  you know, with, you know, kind of the infidelity issue with your dad, or at least it's just,  you know, kind of like the wondering about that."
SPEAKER_00,272.884,275.199," I mean, I think you kind of know that that was probably what was going on."
SPEAKER_00,275.32,288.278," But then, you know, and then moving you how harsh and critical she was issues with Brooke,  you know, even I still even remember too for her to have gotten to the point where she  wouldn't even let you like go to your grandmother's funeral or at least, you know, kind of."
SPEAKER_00,288.72,297.869," So all those things have been so like, you know, front and center, you know, and so now  to feel like that she's made this real dramatic shift and, you know, wanting to start being  a mom."
SPEAKER_00,298.42,302.877, But it sounds like that you're really working to try to manage that in a better way.
SPEAKER_01,303.663,303.887, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,304.52,306.058," I mean, like we still, butt heads a little bit."
SPEAKER_00,306.342,306.628, I'm sure.
SPEAKER_00,307.648,307.852, But yeah.
SPEAKER_00,308.444,308.526, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,309.24,314.779," But when you do butt heads, what is it, how are you, what happens in terms of your eating  when you guys kind of like, when you feel like that there's a little bit of a friction?"
SPEAKER_01,315.281,320.62," I mean, I guess that's like kind of what leads back to things."
SPEAKER_01,320.68,323.179, Like things were really good this weekend for the most part.
SPEAKER_01,323.32,335.297," And then kind of when I was leaving, she just like, and they're just brought up things about  wanting to know more about life and whatnot and what's going on at school and if I'm seeing"
SPEAKER_01,336.08,336.243, anyone.
SPEAKER_01,337.201,339.639," Yeah, it's just, I'm like, we don't have that relationship."
SPEAKER_00,339.962,340.146, Right.
SPEAKER_00,341.064,341.84, That felt really stressful.
SPEAKER_01,341.84,341.922, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,342.84,345.639," So I'd say like when I got back to school, like right after that."
SPEAKER_00,345.881,346.411, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,346.881,347.473, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,347.84,349.456, And she like called me.
SPEAKER_00,350.269,350.452, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,352.224,380.331," Well, it makes a lot of sense because again, you know, like, I know that we've really reviewed  this quite a bit, but you know, historically that's how it's been, you know, that that's  really been a real, and it really clarifies why we're working on this is because it's  so clear that when the two of you have like these rough patches that it really all of  a sudden evokes all these like negative feelings and that's when food like really, you know,  you know, kicks in."
SPEAKER_01,380.76,385.456," Yeah, she makes little comments though, like seeing what I'm wearing, like, ah, that looks"
SPEAKER_01,387.01,387.255, cute.
SPEAKER_00,388.051,388.193, Right.
SPEAKER_00,388.54,388.785, Right.
SPEAKER_00,389.52,389.602, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,390.52,391.52," So it's really hard to, you know, I can understand that it's really hard to let that go."
SPEAKER_00,391.52,394.256," I mean, because obviously there's a lot of, lot of feelings that you have about that."
SPEAKER_00,394.94,395.124, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,396.349,396.512, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,397.16,401.96," On the other hand too, it seems like that, you know, things have been going really well."
SPEAKER_00,402.101,408.676," How have things been going in terms of just in general, like school, friendships, you  know, anything else that's kind of on the horizon?"
SPEAKER_01,409.843,411.453," Yeah, kind of seeing a guy."
SPEAKER_00,412.842,413.067, Cool.
SPEAKER_00,414.826,417.08," I won't get too excited about that, but tell me about him."
SPEAKER_00,417.16,417.589, Tell me about him.
SPEAKER_01,418.242,418.487, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,419.201,420.099, You sound like my mother.
SPEAKER_00,423.933,425.76," No, what's his, you have to at least give me his name."
SPEAKER_00,425.901,426.779, What's his name?
SPEAKER_01,427.78,428.74, His name is Alan.
SPEAKER_00,429.066,429.27, Alan.
SPEAKER_00,429.801,430.066, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,430.801,430.923, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,431.76,432.005, All right.
SPEAKER_00,432.76,436.234," Well, did you like, all right, I'm not going to blow this out of proportion, but how, how,  how did that kind of come about?"
SPEAKER_01,438.844,446.42, We had a class together and kind of went and studied at a coffee shop.
SPEAKER_01,446.948,447.315, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,448.062,452.278, And then just kind of asked to like do a movie night and I was like chill and good.
SPEAKER_00,452.82,453.004, Nice.
SPEAKER_01,453.8,454.024, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,455.208,455.494," No, like, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,455.984,456.229, Nice.
SPEAKER_01,457.76,458.76," And I was like, oh, I'm really happy."
SPEAKER_00,458.76,459.107, That's great.
SPEAKER_00,459.76,460.76, So a lot of really nice things that are going on.
SPEAKER_00,460.76,461.699," Yeah, that's terrific."
SPEAKER_00,462.046,462.27, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,462.8,467.169," So then for you to go like from, you know, cause you know, we kind of got going with  this thing."
SPEAKER_00,467.72,471.712," It was kind of like you were full on binge eating, you know, virtually every day, sometimes  twice a day."
SPEAKER_00,472.12,479.319," And now to be down to, you know, three, like in the space of like, you know, you know,  just like seven, eight weeks is pretty remarkable."
SPEAKER_00,479.52,481.36, So now I'm really pleased with how hard you've been working.
SPEAKER_00,481.36,484.08," Cause you've really been pushing yourself, you know, I really appreciate it."
SPEAKER_00,484.221,486.44, And I know this stuff with your mom is particularly hard.
SPEAKER_01,486.583,486.685, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,487.481,488.399, It's been really hard for you.
SPEAKER_01,488.44,491.435," I guess like not being able to, like, I don't feel comfortable really telling her yet about."
SPEAKER_00,492.483,492.667, Right.
SPEAKER_00,494.986,511.756," And you may not, you know, I mean, it's like, you know, I know that we talked about,  there's like, maybe there are times when you just don't really want to share some of that  stuff, you know, and, and I think sometimes my experience has been some parents, like,  you know, the goal is not to make her feel bad."
SPEAKER_00,512.32,522.279," If you would want to share it, you'd want to share it knowing that she would hold onto  that and keep it and really connect with you around it and want to be helpful rather than  like, like, Oh yeah, you were so mean to me."
SPEAKER_00,522.4,527.158," Now I have an eating disorder, you know, cause then that, that feels, you know, that doesn't  feel quite right."
SPEAKER_00,527.32,532.637," And I know that that's, you know, I know that you have a lot of hard feelings, but I don't  really feel like that that's how you'd want that to go, you know?"
SPEAKER_00,533.162,533.346, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,534.201,538.259," And I know we've talked about it a lot, but how are things going with your dad?"
SPEAKER_01,539.152,539.274, Good.
SPEAKER_01,539.907,540.111, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,540.764,540.989, Good.
SPEAKER_01,541.8,542.29, He's doing well.
SPEAKER_01,542.84,546.72," Uh, hoping that he's coming up here to school to see me."
SPEAKER_00,546.943,547.269, Oh nice.
SPEAKER_00,547.8,548.8, When does he plan to visit?
SPEAKER_01,548.984,549.8, A couple of weeks.
SPEAKER_00,549.882,550.31, Great.
SPEAKER_00,550.922,551.167," Oh, nice."
SPEAKER_00,551.8,552.8, That'd be really nice for you to spend time with him.
SPEAKER_00,553.167,553.453, That's great.
SPEAKER_00,554.31,554.8, That's really great.
SPEAKER_00,555.453,555.637, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,555.8,557.318, So let's talk some more about this thing with your mom.
SPEAKER_00,557.48,563.431," Cause I feel like that, I mean, I know it's tough, but I guess I've been thinking about  this a lot."
SPEAKER_00,563.88,580.317," And especially after last session that, that given the fact that, you know, you and Brooke  are so close and it does feel like that your mom is, at least she seems like she's making,  she's trying to make an attempt to connect with you."
SPEAKER_00,581.041,596.72," Um, um, whether or not, you know, at what point would you feel like that you, well,  what would you need from her in order to feel like that you could kind of like, maybe not  let down the walls, but kind of soften those a little bit."
SPEAKER_00,596.76,602.619," I mean, is there something, is there something that like, if you could ask her like, okay,  mom, if you did this, then I would do this."
SPEAKER_00,602.76,609.655," Not that you would do that, but I just wondered if like, what would you, ideally, what would  you like to see in order to feel like that you could connect with her more?"
SPEAKER_01,610.66,619.808," I mean, like, I wish she really recognized like kind of the pressures that she put on  me back in the day."
SPEAKER_01,623.237,623.48," Um, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,623.52,634.16," And just like now to just, I don't know, just kind of be there in the moment instead of  like trying so hard to like, I don't know, cause things still come out."
SPEAKER_01,634.18,636.335, Like she still makes her little comments about things.
SPEAKER_00,637.794,637.998, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,638.815,638.896, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,639.08,651.96," I know we talked about this, but have you gotten to the point yet where you felt like  that you could like even let her know that, that, that puts a lot of pressure on you or  that the comment that she makes kind of hurt your feelings?"
SPEAKER_00,652.081,653.555, Cause I know that in the moment you feel it.
SPEAKER_00,654.341,670.843," Um, but what would it be like for you if you were to just like, yeah, say like, you know,  I, I know that you're, I know that you mean well, I mean, maybe she doesn't, but maybe  it's sometimes important to approach that way, but it really hurts my feelings or, you  know, I feel like that that really puts a lot of pressure on me to look a particular  way."
SPEAKER_01,671.72,676.928," And, you know, so I mean, I am seeing that I like starting to see that she does mean  well."
SPEAKER_01,678.061,688.599," Uh, yeah, but yeah, I guess I could definitely get to that point of being able to really  express that to her."
SPEAKER_00,689.007,689.231, Right.
SPEAKER_00,689.7,690.435, Cause I know that you did that.
SPEAKER_00,690.721,691.598, You've done that with your roommate.
SPEAKER_00,691.7,700.057, I know there've been other times when people have done that because I know that that's been  kind of part of the bigger issue is just knowing what it is you're feeling and also being able  to kind of give voice to that.
SPEAKER_00,700.341,723.877," And you know, I was thinking about that relationship with your mom because it does seem like that  every once in a while she kind of like jabs you or she'll send something out and, and,  and the way that you take it in is more like harsh, critical, you know, her and um, and  I just don't know, like kind of like with Kathy when you finally talk with her, how  it's like, it was like, it was like, Oh, of course."
SPEAKER_00,724.2,731.286," Like, you know, uh, you know, I'll try to be more sensitive and I'm not really sure,  you know, whether or not your mom would be, yeah, I mean, I guess that's something that  she could do."
SPEAKER_01,732.0,735.997, I guess I worry that cause we've always been kind of defensive towards each other.
SPEAKER_01,736.941,739.22, I just worry that like that will happen again.
SPEAKER_01,739.441,743.398," I mean, I don't know, like it might not because of how things happen."
SPEAKER_00,744.264,744.489, Right.
SPEAKER_01,745.04,748.036," But yeah, I guess I'm worried that, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,749.382,766.598," Well, I think there are times too when I wonder if like, um, maybe if there's a time when  you say something like, I know there've been times when you kind of snap back at her, you  know, or you'll kind of like, you know, bark or kind of jab her a little bit."
SPEAKER_00,767.221,784.876," Um, what if, you know, again, what if you thought about like, because it sounds like  that you're really aware when you do that because you know that when she says something,  you have a tendency to jab back, you could just say, you know, you know, I realized I  was, that was a jab at you and I'm really sorry."
SPEAKER_00,786.181,792.769, I'm aware that sometimes I kind of get really critical with you and I don't feel very good  about that.
SPEAKER_00,793.3,796.819," You know, I wonder how she would, you know, if that would, what that would do."
SPEAKER_00,797.342,801.217," Maybe it wouldn't do anything or it may make you feel a little bit too vulnerable, but  you think about it."
SPEAKER_00,801.481,821.834," I mean, and, um, you know, kind of mull that over in your mind about what that might be  like because my experience has been that sometimes, you know, I hate the phrase be a bigger person  because I, you know, I didn't want that to come across that way, but sometimes in order  to change relationships, somebody has to be willing to kind of like kind of be willing  to do something just a little different."
SPEAKER_00,822.4,829.56," And since it seems like you have a growing awareness of, you know, the re interactions  that you have with her, I wonder if that might be worthwhile."
SPEAKER_00,829.84,830.697," Yeah, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,830.962,831.167, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,831.84,831.922, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,832.941,835.978," Mull it over and think about it and, um, and we'll keep talking about it."
SPEAKER_00,836.26,845.038," Um, but yeah, it sounds like it was a really terrific week and, um, been working really  hard and it really pays off because again, the more you've done that, we've seen real  positive impact on your eating."
SPEAKER_00,845.16,846.078, So nice.
SPEAKER_00,846.263,846.489, Nice.
