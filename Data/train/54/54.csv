SPEAKER_00," Hey Carly, how are you doing today?",14.119,14.9
SPEAKER_01," I'm good, how are you?",15.0,15.523
SPEAKER_00," I'm doing well, thanks for asking.",18.1,19.169
SPEAKER_00, What's been going on this last week?,20.44,21.533
SPEAKER_01, I've just been feeling kind of in a rut.,22.942,27.958
SPEAKER_01, I've been looking for a job and haven't really gotten anywhere.,29.04,31.476
SPEAKER_01, And then I had a drink the other night.,32.04,37.578
SPEAKER_01," And I just felt like me not having a job and me going out and having that drink, it wasn't deserved.",38.721,48.459
SPEAKER_01, And I just felt like such a loser because that was the time that I should have been at work if I had a job.,49.06,54.02
SPEAKER_01, And instead I was at the bar drinking.,54.221,56.074
SPEAKER_01, So I had one drink and then it led to another because then I just felt worse and I figured I had one.,57.56,63.698
SPEAKER_00, So how much did you drink in total?,66.327,68.837
SPEAKER_01, I think I lost track after four or five.,72.106,76.838
SPEAKER_00, How long had it been since you had a drink before that?,79.566,83.858
SPEAKER_01, I did really well.,85.08,85.702
SPEAKER_01,It was I think like three weeks or so.,86.264,89.394
SPEAKER_00, So you did really well and then you had one drink and that just made you feel like you weren't successful.,91.08,99.98
SPEAKER_01, I felt like a loser.,100.524,101.454
SPEAKER_00, You felt like a loser.,102.08,103.804
SPEAKER_00,And you feel that kind of led to drinking some more.,103.824,108.656
SPEAKER_00, So you had a rough time with things.,111.228,112.315
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,113.6,113.947
SPEAKER_00, How about now?,115.244,115.748
SPEAKER_01," I mean now I just kind of, I don't know, I'm afraid to go back.",117.66,123.878
SPEAKER_01, I'm afraid to go out with some friends.,124.64,126.445
SPEAKER_01,They invite me out to dinner.,126.526,127.889
SPEAKER_01,But I know there's alcohol.,128.591,129.634
SPEAKER_00, Is that where you were when you had that first drink?,131.6,133.369
SPEAKER_00,Was out with friends?,133.711,134.394
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,135.942,138.318
SPEAKER_00, There's a few things going on.,139.12,139.986
SPEAKER_00, We've talked in the past about separating the behavior from the person.,142.14,149.218
SPEAKER_00," So behavior is what we do, not who we are.",150.642,154.538
SPEAKER_00, Do you remember those discussions?,155.16,157.254
SPEAKER_00," And correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like, I'm going to use some different words than you used,  but it sounds like when you had that first drink, you're kind of ashamed that you had a drink  and you had it during the time when you would have been working.",158.401,172.253
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,173.64,173.862
SPEAKER_01,That's pretty accurate.,174.367,175.236
SPEAKER_00, That's pretty accurate.,175.64,176.125
SPEAKER_00,All right.,176.246,176.448
SPEAKER_00," So taking yourself kind of back to that moment, right, where you had that first drink,  like you finished that first drink.",178.182,185.707
SPEAKER_00, What was your thought at that moment?,188.361,191.792
SPEAKER_01," Just like, shameful.",194.16,196.644
SPEAKER_01,"Like I did really, really well and then here I was and I just finished a drink and I knew I wanted another one.",196.664,205.779
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,206.782,207.103
SPEAKER_00,"So shameful is kind of like the feeling, but the thought is I did really, really well.",207.664,211.977
SPEAKER_00," So that's what you were thinking, was I did really, really well.",214.223,216.333
SPEAKER_00, And was that the end of the thought or was there more before you had that next drink?,218.161,225.598
SPEAKER_01, I guess just I was doing well and then I had a drink and I just felt like an awful person.,227.522,236.68
SPEAKER_01, So I figured what was the hurt in having more.,237.383,240.636
SPEAKER_00," So the sequence would have been you had the drink, you felt shameful.",242.22,245.898
SPEAKER_00," At the same time you're thinking that you were doing really well and then just really, as you said before,  you just felt like a loser and then you decided might as well just have the second drink.",246.561,262.939
SPEAKER_00," So another thought might be that, like I might as well just have the second drink.",263.601,269.297
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,270.72,271.21
SPEAKER_00, So you can see how there's some thoughts and some feelings at work right as you finish that first drink.,271.88,279.397
SPEAKER_00," Was it fairly quick, were those thoughts and feelings fairly, occur very quickly after the drink?",280.72,286.519
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I would say as I was finishing and then finished.",286.8,290.358
SPEAKER_00, So right away you regretted it.,292.387,294.917
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,296.084,296.387
SPEAKER_00," And in that regret, as you thought about it, thought might as well just continue drinking now because you kind of blew it.",299.302,309.2
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I already messed up, I might as well keep going.",309.421,313.079
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,313.75,314.016
SPEAKER_00, And that's a common cycle to fall into and you had three weeks where you hadn't had a drink prior to that.,315.223,319.377
SPEAKER_00," So let's look at this, let's try to separate the behavior from yourself a little bit.",321.043,324.738
SPEAKER_00," If you had a friend who was in the same predicament, right, who had a history of using alcohol and then had three weeks without any alcohol use,  and then their behavior was to have a drink, what would you think of them?",327.703,343.456
SPEAKER_01," I would think that they had a rough day or something must have happened where, I mean it's just one drink.",346.78,353.259
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,354.025,354.576
SPEAKER_00," A rough day with one drink, and what would you think of their behavior?",355.28,357.696
SPEAKER_00, How would you categorize that behavior?,358.361,359.971
SPEAKER_01, It's just they made a mistake.,364.381,366.495
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,367.729,367.851
SPEAKER_00, So not ideal.,368.684,369.876
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,370.3,370.504
SPEAKER_00," Depending on their point of view, maybe a little irresponsible.",372.004,374.476
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I think irresponsible would be...",375.542,377.213
SPEAKER_00, Irresponsible?,378.28,378.994
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,379.321,379.504
SPEAKER_00, All right.,380.729,381.015
SPEAKER_00, But you wouldn't necessarily characterize them as a bad person.,381.28,383.334
SPEAKER_01, No.,385.045,385.127
SPEAKER_00, But their behavior was a bit irresponsible.,385.8,388.176
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,388.8,389.004
SPEAKER_00," You know, in terms of like their recovery plan, which would be to not drink.",389.8,392.438
SPEAKER_01, Right.,393.249,393.392
SPEAKER_00," But when you apply that same examination to your own situation, how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink?",394.8,404.658
SPEAKER_01, It was my mistake.,406.603,408.259
SPEAKER_01, It was something that...,408.34,409.209
SPEAKER_01, It makes me a worse person for doing it.,411.064,413.556
SPEAKER_00," So you see how you're being a little, well, it would be quite a bit rougher on yourself.",415.103,420.119
SPEAKER_00, Like your evaluation of yourself is fairly harsh.,420.862,424.256
SPEAKER_00, You mentioned loser earlier and ashamed.,425.722,428.536
SPEAKER_00, Whereas you wouldn't necessarily evaluate somebody else that way.,431.703,433.776
SPEAKER_00, How would you evaluate your behavior?,435.426,436.618
SPEAKER_00, How would you judge your behavior taking that first drink?,437.302,441.378
SPEAKER_01, Shameful.,442.044,442.432
SPEAKER_01," I mean, irresponsible.",443.968,445.82
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,445.942,446.309
SPEAKER_01, And just bad overall.,448.085,451.8
SPEAKER_00," So bad, irresponsible, shameful.",452.181,454.792
SPEAKER_00," Is there a way to separate that behavior in terms of your thinking, in terms of the way you evaluate it from yourself?",457.38,465.36
SPEAKER_00," Like are you in the behavior together, enmeshed, or can you be separated?",465.841,471.738
SPEAKER_01, I think we could be separated.,476.521,479.139
SPEAKER_00, Mm-hmm.,479.544,479.748
SPEAKER_01, But it feels like we're... like I am that behavior.,481.763,486.338
SPEAKER_00," In that moment, it's very congruent for you.",487.081,489.779
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,490.186,490.39
SPEAKER_00, The shame matches the behavior.,490.92,493.457
SPEAKER_00, The behavior matches shame.,493.88,495.052
SPEAKER_00, Like it's... they're one at that moment.,495.88,498.034
SPEAKER_00," But really, logically, rationally, you're you.",499.341,504.857
SPEAKER_00, Right?,505.962,506.104
SPEAKER_00, Your identity and values and your behavior is something you do.,507.4,511.012
SPEAKER_00," But in the moment, it's hard for you to see that.",513.44,514.996
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,516.053,516.196
SPEAKER_00," Looking back on it now, are you able to see the distinction between what people do and what they are?",516.942,522.039
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,523.966,524.289
SPEAKER_01," I mean, just because you have one drink doesn't make you a horrible person in the thing, right?",526.222,531.618
SPEAKER_00," No, certainly not.",532.663,533.43
SPEAKER_00," And you were clean for three weeks and you had one drink, so really your behavior was a slip.",535.221,542.078
SPEAKER_00, Right?,544.657,544.859
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,545.144,545.43
SPEAKER_00," And irresponsible in relationship to your goals, I suppose, but still a slip.",546.361,552.519
SPEAKER_00, And you could have stopped.,553.405,554.415
SPEAKER_00," But that shame got a hold of you, right?",556.188,557.9
SPEAKER_00," That thought, well, now I've done it.",558.627,559.839
SPEAKER_01, I blew it.,560.91,561.334
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, so with that mentality, you kind of set yourself up for drinking more.",562.44,567.116
SPEAKER_00," So I think this is important because we've seen this cycle, like where you have weeks of sobriety,  and then you'll drink a bit and then have weeks of sobriety.",569.46,580.038
SPEAKER_00, And I'm wondering if part of the difficulty you're facing is you're not coping with the slips as just slips.,581.001,589.438
SPEAKER_01, No way.,590.767,591.073
SPEAKER_00, You're allowing them to be gateways into a lot more drinking than a slip.,591.96,597.017
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,599.082,599.674
SPEAKER_01, That sounds pretty accurate.,599.96,600.768
SPEAKER_00," And you see how the shameful feelings kind of just interfere with the behavior that's really consistent with your goals,  which would be to not continue drinking.",602.96,613.054
SPEAKER_00," Another piece of this, too, is the associating with friends who drink.",615.583,621.099
SPEAKER_00, You're putting yourself in a treacherous situation.,622.083,625.48
SPEAKER_00," And again, that's a behavior, right?",626.346,628.48
SPEAKER_00, That doesn't make you one way or the other.,628.541,630.116
SPEAKER_00, It's a behavior.,630.521,631.215
SPEAKER_00," How would you judge that behavior, going out with friends?",631.701,633.795
SPEAKER_01, I don't know.,639.113,639.48
SPEAKER_01, Difficult because I like being around those people.,640.201,643.417
SPEAKER_01, But I guess it would be risky.,644.06,648.779
SPEAKER_00, Risky.,650.041,650.408
SPEAKER_00,Okay.,650.531,650.694
SPEAKER_00, It's a risky behavior.,651.566,652.556
SPEAKER_00, And what does it make you?,653.342,654.53
SPEAKER_00,Who are you?,654.611,655.134
SPEAKER_00, Because you do that behavior.,656.745,658.617
SPEAKER_00, How do you feel about yourself when you take that risky behavior?,659.221,662.337
SPEAKER_01, Guilty.,663.776,663.939
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,664.184,664.531
SPEAKER_00, So you have guilt and you go out with your friends.,665.543,667.774
SPEAKER_00, And then you have shame if you drink.,669.762,672.419
SPEAKER_00," And both, in this case, both emotions that kind of point you in the direction of more drinking.",673.583,678.517
SPEAKER_00," So part of this behavioral strategy here is to avoid those circumstances,  like to recognize that that's a risky behavior which you have.",680.982,689.173
SPEAKER_00, And the other part would be to deal more effectively if you do so.,690.52,694.436
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,695.642,695.847
SPEAKER_00, Right.,696.561,696.785
SPEAKER_00, Does that separation of what we do and who we are make sense to you rationally?,698.421,703.599
SPEAKER_01, Kind of.,705.469,705.856
SPEAKER_00, It feels a little unnatural though.,706.323,707.777
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,708.06,708.264
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,709.224,709.611
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,710.305,710.448
SPEAKER_00," So maybe as you're confronting similar situations in the course of the next week,  you could be aware of behaviors that might put you at risk  and try to separate your identity from that behavior.",713.04,730.259
SPEAKER_00, So just judge the behavior.,731.186,732.297
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,732.805,733.029
SPEAKER_00, Right.,734.152,734.315
SPEAKER_00, And don't pass any judgment on yourself.,734.56,736.835
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,738.267,739.358
SPEAKER_01," Kind of, yeah.",739.58,739.948
SPEAKER_00," It might help you to, since it's a little tough to,  because right now the feeling and the judgment are intertwined, right?",742.66,752.878
SPEAKER_00," It might help to write down when these things happen  and kind of write down like one row for,  this is how I judge this behavior that I'm thinking about doing  and this is how I judge myself.",754.08,767.06
SPEAKER_00," So if you see a lot of self-judgment, that might be a clue  that you're falling into that cycle a little bit.",767.12,772.019
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,772.366,772.509
SPEAKER_00, Where you're making decisions based on that emotion  instead of a rational judgment of the behavior.,773.08,777.308
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,779.304,779.468
SPEAKER_00, Would that help a little bit?,780.162,781.08
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,781.08,781.264
SPEAKER_01, I think that would probably be beneficial.,782.6,784.277
SPEAKER_00, Right.,785.11,785.273
SPEAKER_00," So that will be our plan going forward until next week  is note, document your judgment about your behavior.",785.6,795.199
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,795.661,795.824
SPEAKER_00, And any judgment you may have by yourself.,796.681,798.6
SPEAKER_00, Right?,798.763,798.967
SPEAKER_00, And there's some insight that can be gained there.,799.661,801.58
SPEAKER_00, Right?,801.6,802.049
SPEAKER_00, You kind of distinguished the two.,802.62,804.6
SPEAKER_00, And make a note of those and try to use that evidence  before making a decision that might put you in a risky spot.,804.62,809.392
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,811.171,811.539
SPEAKER_00, Is that the plan?,812.181,813.12
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I think I can try that.",813.161,814.059
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,814.549,814.732
SPEAKER_00, Good.,815.202,815.324
SPEAKER_00, I'll see you next week and we'll see how you did with those goals.,816.261,819.06
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,819.487,819.712
SPEAKER_01, Bye.,820.12,820.308
