SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,32.408,32.653
SPEAKER_00, Can you give me some examples?,33.202,34.253
SPEAKER_01," Like for instance, I go to the dry cleaner to pick up my fiance's uniforms and the lady  had them like all bagged together and I mean I could have easily just asked her because  she separate them but I began to yell causing a big commotion because I was so frustrated  and angry.",36.283,55.424
SPEAKER_01, She actually was about to call the police to escort me out and I don't think I'm even  allowed to go back to the dry cleaner anymore.,58.201,64.616

SPEAKER_01, My neighbor's dog was barking late at night and I know my neighbors really can't control  that but I get into a huge fight with my neighbor's argument.,69.064,77.478

SPEAKER_01, Nothing that I can really think of.,115.727,116.98
SPEAKER_01," Just when I'm overwhelmed and I have so much to do, I kind of just break down and just  become extremely upset with everything around me.",117.561,129.414
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so you're getting upset, you have some anger.",132.044,134.755

SPEAKER_01," When I go to the, I go work out at the kickboxing class, I'm like, I go all out.",141.561,148.92
SPEAKER_01, Like I use that as like a release.,149.0,150.253
SPEAKER_01, I'm punching the bags extremely hard.,151.544,153.96
SPEAKER_01, I actually had hurt my wrist last week.,154.04,157.296
SPEAKER_01," I just go all out in there and my trainer kind of notices like, are you okay?",158.863,163.0
SPEAKER_01," And I'm like, yeah, it's just relief kind of getting all the anger I had out.",163.0,168.897
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so that experience for you, you feel like you're releasing more energy than maybe  the other people in the kickboxing class.",170.923,178.758
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, way more.",179.323,179.667
SPEAKER_00, Way more.,181.51,181.816
SPEAKER_01," I'm like loud, I'm sweating bullets, I'm just going all out, like extreme anger.",182.201,188.456
SPEAKER_00," Alright, so the, in recent memory, your anger has increased, but it's still not really clear  what's going on that's causing the anger.",191.902,204.919
SPEAKER_01," Not really, I just feel like frustrated, just have too much going on at the moment.",206.124,209.9
SPEAKER_01," So it's just kind of like, I just feel overwhelmed I guess and I take it out.",210.141,214.859
SPEAKER_00," You feel busy, like in your daily life, like a lot of responsibilities?",216.005,219.0

SPEAKER_01," It feels like I just really don't get a break or any other help, it's just me doing everything.",273.02,278.699
SPEAKER_00, You're doing everything?,279.061,279.816
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,280.061,280.939
SPEAKER_00, And has it always been this way?,281.0,282.065
SPEAKER_01," Not always, but it seems, it's been like this for some time.",285.04,289.237
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,290.0,290.245
SPEAKER_00, Were you really just doing everything in the home?,291.444,292.939
SPEAKER_01, Everything.,293.764,294.226
SPEAKER_00," I want to ask you, I want to ask you or mention a few words, right?",297.261,304.158
SPEAKER_00," And I would like you to, if you're okay with this exercise, tell me the first thing that comes to mind.",305.04,312.419
SPEAKER_00," And you can, when I say a word, you can offer several responses.",313.04,316.357
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,317.306,317.449
SPEAKER_00," But try not to invest a lot of thought into the response, but more just what occurs to you.",318.1,324.438
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,325.061,325.286
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,326.204,326.898
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,327.184,327.429
SPEAKER_00, All right.,328.265,328.98
SPEAKER_00, So the first word is home.,329.0,329.844
SPEAKER_01," Structure, responsibility, repetition.",333.621,343.0
SPEAKER_00, Repetition.,343.745,344.268
SPEAKER_00, All right.,346.551,346.837
SPEAKER_00," Let me give you another word, relationship.",347.06,349.668
SPEAKER_01," Conflict, power struggle, disagreements.",354.802,361.715
SPEAKER_00, All right.,364.367,364.939
SPEAKER_00, Let me offer you another word.,365.0,365.848
SPEAKER_00, Work.,367.06,367.281
SPEAKER_01, Independence.,373.121,373.946
SPEAKER_01, Freedom.,376.0,376.322
SPEAKER_01, Able to express creativity.,379.181,380.99
SPEAKER_00, Good.,383.531,383.714
SPEAKER_00, All right.,384.02,384.306
SPEAKER_00, And how about another word here?,385.121,387.195
SPEAKER_00, Power.,388.302,388.664
SPEAKER_01, A constant struggle.,391.0,392.225
SPEAKER_01, Extremely controlling.,396.24,399.105
SPEAKER_00, So do you see any themes in the words that you provided back?,408.22,416.892
SPEAKER_01, It just seems like everything is like really controlled and structured.,423.241,426.859
SPEAKER_00, Controlled and structured.,427.544,428.53
SPEAKER_00, What's the source of that control and structure?,430.705,432.899
SPEAKER_00, Or is there a source of it?,433.0,433.945
SPEAKER_01," A lot of it may come from my fiancé, now that I'm thinking about it.",437.622,442.496
SPEAKER_00, Tell me what you're thinking.,444.04,445.309
SPEAKER_01," Because I feel like he doesn't give me the freedom or the ability to do a lot of the things that I would like to do, like work.",447.481,455.92
SPEAKER_01, And I think he should help more with the kids around the house and do things.,456.181,460.819
SPEAKER_01, And I shouldn't have to do everything.,461.584,463.738
SPEAKER_01, And I feel like that's probably a lot of the...,464.844,467.276
SPEAKER_01," Why I'm so frustrated, because I feel that I don't have any help.",468.765,471.0
SPEAKER_01, It's like I'm single and I'm doing everything on my own.,471.161,474.0
SPEAKER_01, So that's probably where the bulk of my frustrations come from.,474.843,479.418
SPEAKER_00, All right.,480.571,480.796
SPEAKER_00," So as you're telling me this and you're explaining kind of that relationship with your fiancé, what are you feeling?",481.0,487.236
SPEAKER_01, I'm feeling angry and disappointed.,489.303,490.98
SPEAKER_01, Like I don't really know if I want to further anything because will it be like this forever?,491.822,497.298
SPEAKER_01, So I'm kind of just like angry and frustrated.,498.984,502.036
SPEAKER_00," Is this similar to the anger that you've been experiencing recently, like at the dry cleaner and other places?",504.383,510.84
SPEAKER_01," It's far worse than that, but it's like...",512.186,514.216
SPEAKER_01, I think that's why I'm always so upset and angry.,516.101,519.497
SPEAKER_00, So you're thinking that maybe that relationship or some part of that relationship is what's really causing the anger?,522.04,531.178
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,532.286,532.469
SPEAKER_01, Because I feel alone at the same time completely.,533.321,538.676
SPEAKER_01, Like I'm not in a fair relationship.,540.181,542.066
SPEAKER_01,It's like I'm in a controlling one and I don't have freedom to do anything.,542.126,546.9
SPEAKER_01, I don't have help and it's just... it's weighing a lot of stress on me.,547.0,550.256
SPEAKER_00, All right.,553.06,553.321
SPEAKER_00,"So is this... as you talk about this, do you feel like this is new information that you're kind of realizing something that you didn't realize before?",553.361,563.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, because honestly I kind of... I never really focused on that aspect of it.",563.461,570.96
SPEAKER_01, I kind of just thought that's the way it should go and I just thought I was angry because I just had bad days.,571.14,577.799
SPEAKER_01, I never really looked deep into it because I try so hard to make everything in my family right.,578.0,584.418
SPEAKER_01, So I kind of really don't pay attention.,586.286,588.196
SPEAKER_01,I kind of ignore it.,588.296,589.0
SPEAKER_01," But now that I'm thinking and putting out different things, it's going to spin into how I really feel.",590.08,595.679
SPEAKER_00, So you feel this is kind of a big moment in terms of awareness?,598.341,603.96
SPEAKER_01," Definitely because I don't think I would have... like I said, I think I'm kind of...",605.161,610.0
SPEAKER_01, I try to hide it and really don't focus much on it because I want things to be perfect.,612.12,616.96
SPEAKER_01, So I think I kind of ignore it.,617.0,619.859
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,624.162,624.483
SPEAKER_00,So maybe through this session you've developed more insight about what's contributing to the anger.,625.685,633.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, definitely because I would just go off for no reason at all and just later just think about like, why did I even do that?",635.742,643.92
SPEAKER_00," But this source of anger, this relationship, you recognize this as maybe more causal or more contributing.",646.923,655.76
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,656.265,656.367
SPEAKER_00, Whereas the other objects of your anger you weren't really sure.,657.884,661.0
SPEAKER_01," I wasn't sure at all why, but with that I definitely could see the reasons why I'm angry in my relationship.",661.04,668.94
SPEAKER_00," Alright Jasmine, I feel like we've made some progress here and I'd like you to, between now and the next session,  if you're comfortable with it, kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to the surface,  what information has maybe been revealed to you a little bit and we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue.",670.561,695.8
SPEAKER_00, Does that sound like a good plan?,696.041,697.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, definitely.",697.0,697.946
SPEAKER_01,Definitely is a good plan.,697.966,699.356
SPEAKER_00, Well I appreciate you coming in today and I'll see you in a week.,702.205,706.0
SPEAKER_00," Okay, thank you.",706.388,707.0
