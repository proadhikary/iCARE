SPEAKER_00,20.182,31.939, Hi cinderella. well we have about  half an hour together this time  And how are you feeling right now?
SPEAKER_00,32.182,33.1, What's your awareness?
SPEAKER_00,33.582,37.494, Is a bit of a kind of situation different from last time?
SPEAKER_01,40.686,43.678," No, I'm still feeling the same."
SPEAKER_00,44.302,44.711, Right.
SPEAKER_01,45.813,46.139," Just, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,46.261,48.537, You said you were going to watch.
SPEAKER_01,49.1,51.734," Just a little frustrated at the moment, that's all."
SPEAKER_00,53.04,55.809, What is the frustration like for you?
SPEAKER_01,59.461,62.838, It's just a tight feeling that I have.
SPEAKER_01,63.34,72.712," I just, yeah, it's very, it's difficult to put into words, but just, it just doesn't  feel good."
SPEAKER_00,74.107,75.758," So, let's shift it to your body."
SPEAKER_00,75.98,77.755, Where in your body do you feel this tight feeling?
SPEAKER_01,78.44,80.409, I think it's in my chest.
SPEAKER_00,82.902,84.038, So that's the heart area.
SPEAKER_00,84.783,86.212, It's the feeling around the heart.
SPEAKER_00,87.46,88.338," Yeah, right."
SPEAKER_00,88.901,93.017, And what is there in that heart when you pay attention to that area in your heart?
SPEAKER_00,93.761,94.7, What do you find there?
SPEAKER_00,94.881,98.62, What sort of thing do you find there?
SPEAKER_01,99.001,103.853," Yes, it's just a really, just a compressing feeling."
SPEAKER_00,106.5,110.476, I noticed that you have been saying it when you talked about your feelings.
SPEAKER_00,111.5,117.624, And I would like to suggest if you can say I instead of it and see what happens in your  body.
SPEAKER_00,119.526,120.089, So go ahead.
SPEAKER_01,122.0,123.576, You actually want me to say?
SPEAKER_00,124.0,124.724," Yes, yes, yes."
SPEAKER_01,127.84,129.059, My chest feels very tired.
SPEAKER_01,129.22,131.977," I feel very frustrated, angry."
SPEAKER_00,132.481,132.665, Angry.
SPEAKER_00,135.506,137.633," So that's what's coming out, frustration, anger."
SPEAKER_00,140.1,143.846, So what are you doing in this moment with your anger as you are sensing it right here  in your chest?
SPEAKER_00,146.685,147.352, In this moment?
SPEAKER_01,148.984,151.095, I'm just accepting it.
SPEAKER_01,152.344,152.916, It's just there.
SPEAKER_00,153.584,154.776, So you're accepting it.
SPEAKER_00,157.646,164.728," And once you accept that anger inside you, what else do you do with that anger, having  accepted it?"
SPEAKER_01,166.921,173.656, It's just a part of me.
SPEAKER_00,175.821,177.648, You notice you are saying it again?
SPEAKER_01,181.173,181.254, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,181.622,182.54, I am angry.
SPEAKER_00,182.744,183.52, Use the word I.
SPEAKER_00,183.601,183.622, I.
SPEAKER_00,184.54,185.54," It's a thing to acknowledge this is you, not something out there."
SPEAKER_00,185.601,186.54, You do it a lot.
SPEAKER_00,186.64,189.87," And you think it's something very strong, you put it out there."
SPEAKER_00,193.54,195.075, So it's a safe way to put it.
SPEAKER_00,195.963,197.412, If you say I feel angry.
SPEAKER_01,199.873,200.5, I feel angry.
SPEAKER_00,201.043,202.151, And who do you feel angry at?
SPEAKER_01,203.782,204.651," My ex-husband, yes."
SPEAKER_00,205.883,206.651, Your ex-husband.
SPEAKER_00,208.303,218.878," Sandra, having just explored some of your feelings around the situation you have, I'm  going to suggest that you speak to Jeff on an empty chair."
SPEAKER_00,219.701,231.377," This may be a little uncomfortable, but it helped me to facilitate a process where I  become an observer and you'll be dialoguing with the party that you are actually having  to deal with."
SPEAKER_00,232.666,236.732, And I'll be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the things that  we could do to change the process.
SPEAKER_01,237.683,237.928, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,240.066,243.48," Let's bring Jeff, in your imagination, that you ask if Jeff were here."
SPEAKER_00,243.54,244.974, I'll bring a chair.
SPEAKER_01,245.54,245.622, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,246.764,247.356," Welcome, Jeff."
SPEAKER_00,248.065,249.54," I mean, I welcome Jeff."
SPEAKER_00,249.621,251.312, You don't have to.
SPEAKER_00,253.124,254.654, And there's Jeff.
SPEAKER_00,255.64,259.456," So imagine his face, how he looks like, how you remember him now."
SPEAKER_00,261.607,263.077, And bring him in in your fantasy.
SPEAKER_00,263.881,269.379," And then when you're ready, just say whatever comes to you at that moment, this moment spontaneously."
SPEAKER_00,269.56,269.846, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,271.706,272.108, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,274.72,282.299," Jeff, I feel very frustrated about the situation that you have left me and the children in."
SPEAKER_01,283.542,294.334, I don't think you understand how hard it is at times and the things that I have to explain  to them about this situation.
SPEAKER_01,295.941,301.54, It bothers me that you don't go out of your way to spend extra time with the children.
SPEAKER_01,302.181,316.453, And I really believe that in the future they will come to really resent that and not look  at you as their father.
SPEAKER_01,318.001,323.617, I honestly can't understand why you don't want to spend more time with them.
SPEAKER_01,324.66,341.799," And irrespective of what's happened between us and you moving on and so forth, I just  don't think that your children and my children should really suffer in that way."
SPEAKER_01,342.62,350.328, I would like them to have as normal a life as possible and be able to be with both of  their parents.
SPEAKER_01,352.182,357.276, And what is so important rather than them wanting to be with them.
SPEAKER_01,359.506,360.614, It's just very hard.
SPEAKER_00,361.642,362.254, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,362.703,362.948, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,363.601,365.54, So there's a kind of question.
SPEAKER_00,365.782,368.459," You understand why this happened, et cetera, right?"
SPEAKER_00,368.901,377.094," So what next thing we'll do, you'll sit over there and you will be Jeff and see what Jeff  can answer to you as to where he is at."
SPEAKER_00,378.54,383.5," That may be a little bit difficult, but let's do a dialogue."
SPEAKER_00,383.581,384.397, I see if he were here.
SPEAKER_00,384.54,385.356, He's not here anyway.
SPEAKER_01,385.662,385.928, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,386.761,393.489," So we'll be having a dialogue between Jeff, the imaginary Jeff that you have, and you  in the present here and now."
SPEAKER_00,394.54,395.213, Okay?
SPEAKER_01,395.54,397.116, And what is he saying?
SPEAKER_00,397.54,398.03," Well, go ahead."
SPEAKER_00,398.54,399.813, I'm going to suggest instead of over there.
SPEAKER_01,400.887,401.009, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,401.621,403.54," The moment you sit over there, you become Jeff."
SPEAKER_01,403.907,404.173, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,405.54,410.356," And whatever Jeff says to the statement that you made, go ahead, Jeff."
SPEAKER_01,414.282,420.44," Sandra, I know that it must have been hard on you and the kids with me leaving."
SPEAKER_01,420.56,432.037," And it's not that I don't want to spend more time with them, but I am very busy with work  and a few other things that are going on in my life."
SPEAKER_01,433.842,436.374," Sandra, my children do mean a lot to me."
SPEAKER_01,438.704,446.439," And if I was to spend more time with them, though, when I contact you about it, I don't  want you to be short and rude."
SPEAKER_01,447.806,450.54, And I want you to be open to the opportunity.
SPEAKER_00,450.54,450.744, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,451.54,457.54," I'll stop you, Jeff, and say, Sandra, the children really mean a lot to me."
SPEAKER_00,457.842,459.916," Just say that to her again, the statement."
SPEAKER_01,461.465,463.997," Sandra, the children really do mean a lot to me."
SPEAKER_00,464.724,465.213, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,465.601,467.378, So go back to there.
SPEAKER_00,469.863,471.378, So check your frustration over there.
SPEAKER_00,471.54,474.575, How do you feel different about him now that he really cares for the children?
SPEAKER_00,475.963,477.735, And there is a future maybe with him and them?
SPEAKER_00,478.948,479.479, Do you feel that?
SPEAKER_01,479.724,479.948, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,480.54,480.642, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,481.701,484.414, So have you any appreciations to Jeff?
SPEAKER_00,486.043,491.493," I know there are the hurts and frustration and anger, but any appreciation that he still  cares for these children as a father?"
SPEAKER_01,497.362,511.54," I really don't have any appreciation for that because the reason that you've given, that  you're busy, like I'm busy in my life and I still give our children priority, they still  take precedence in my life."
SPEAKER_01,512.063,515.098, And I just don't think that that's right.
SPEAKER_00,515.642,515.826, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,516.54,517.325," And your father, he should be."
SPEAKER_00,520.284,520.867, To the children.
SPEAKER_01,523.54,527.375, You should be proactive in wanting to see them.
SPEAKER_01,528.54,535.756, And I wouldn't mind if you wanted to see them more than what we have agreed.
SPEAKER_01,537.56,548.656," If there are times when you want to do something spontaneous and see them, then feel free to  contact us and see if it's okay."
SPEAKER_00,549.54,549.969, Good.
SPEAKER_00,550.601,550.764, Good.
SPEAKER_00,552.234,552.336, Good.
SPEAKER_00,552.581,552.928, Come over there.
SPEAKER_00,553.681,556.736, You sound like a very good idea.
SPEAKER_00,557.54,558.438, Good offer.
SPEAKER_00,559.122,562.874," Is it, Jeff, are you prepared to take that offer off for the kids' sake?"
SPEAKER_01,568.212,570.339," Well, Sandra, I'm glad that you said that."
SPEAKER_01,571.103,573.535, And I think that's something.
SPEAKER_01,574.741,576.513, That's something that I could look at.
SPEAKER_01,577.58,585.54," But when I contact you, I don't want you to be to be short with me or rude."
SPEAKER_01,586.444,590.54, I want you to consider it and and to be honest.
SPEAKER_01,590.54,590.683, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,591.54,591.724, Great.
SPEAKER_00,592.601,593.275, Go over there.
SPEAKER_00,593.923,595.996, So you're aware what's going on here?
SPEAKER_00,596.683,597.54, The contract's happening.
SPEAKER_01,597.622,598.377, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,599.143,603.52," You're aware that it seems the two parties seem to be agreeing, beginning to agree to  something important."
SPEAKER_00,603.54,604.934, And that's the children.
SPEAKER_00,606.186,607.277, So the children will not suffer.
SPEAKER_00,607.54,617.077," They will actually benefit from that agreement if you two can really, really come to a mutual  agreement to what, how are we going to take care of the children?"
SPEAKER_00,617.62,629.732," Because this thing, no matter how, in my view, no matter how people live together as a couple,  separate together, the contract, life contract is I'm still my father to my children, you're  still my mother to my children."
SPEAKER_00,630.54,633.54," We could only get that anger out, frustration out."
SPEAKER_00,634.084,636.439, We can come to an agreement as to how we're going to work together.
SPEAKER_00,637.223,641.54," Even if we may not live together, we will live with the kids and they'll be happy."
SPEAKER_00,641.621,643.815, Does that make sense to you?
SPEAKER_01,645.275,645.52, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,645.823,647.52, There's a but.
SPEAKER_01,648.065,649.318, But how do I?
SPEAKER_01,649.762,651.459, It's a question.
SPEAKER_00,651.641,652.591," Good, good, good."
SPEAKER_01,654.322,663.52, This is in a counseling session and he hasn't really participated in informing this contract.
SPEAKER_00,664.426,666.419," Yes, but you hear that this happened for you?"
SPEAKER_00,666.54,666.785, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,667.642,668.54, And you've done it.
SPEAKER_00,669.022,674.948," So is there something that now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him, no matter  how he is?"
SPEAKER_00,675.66,681.099, Because there's now a new realization that the children need that father and mother.
SPEAKER_00,682.207,682.873, How's that for you?
SPEAKER_01,684.021,692.259," Yes, maybe I just need to let him know that and just extend the invitation of having more"
SPEAKER_01,692.969,693.132, time.
SPEAKER_00,693.601,694.418, Without that.
SPEAKER_01,694.54,694.642, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,695.744,696.152, Remember?
SPEAKER_01,696.54,696.601, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,697.54,698.54, And you're good at that.
SPEAKER_00,698.54,699.193, You're very good.
SPEAKER_00,699.54,704.152," Watching you working here, you're very good at creating contracts and very clear about  what you want."
SPEAKER_00,705.022,709.299," It's a question of how you can, the two parties can get to that agreement together."
SPEAKER_00,710.348,710.752, What do you think?
SPEAKER_00,712.295,712.458, Great.
SPEAKER_00,712.983,715.5, Because this is a rehearsal for what's going to happen.
SPEAKER_01,715.56,715.764, Okay.
