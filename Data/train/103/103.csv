SPEAKER_00,6.653,9.96," Between here and there, obviously if it were easy, you wouldn't need me."
SPEAKER_00,10.2,11.693, You wouldn't have had 13 therapists.
SPEAKER_00,12.42,17.894," If this were easy, you would have been to a life you wanted a long time ago."
SPEAKER_00,20.3,30.951," So it's obvious that if it were easy, it would already be done because it sounds like you're  a person with a lot of motivation who works really hard because there are very few people  who wouldn't have quit before 13 therapists."
SPEAKER_00,32.38,33.672, So that's a very good quality.
SPEAKER_00,34.62,37.874, The very fact that you've gone through all these therapists is a good sign for us.
SPEAKER_00,39.34,41.15," Nonetheless, it is difficult."
SPEAKER_00,42.86,45.374," Between here and there, there's going to be hell."
SPEAKER_01,47.172,47.66, Exactly.
SPEAKER_00,48.229,48.555, Right.
SPEAKER_00,48.88,54.396, So I figure our number one priority has to be to get you to stay alive through hell so  that we can get to the life you want.
SPEAKER_00,55.185,56.259, And that's where we're at now.
SPEAKER_00,56.441,68.639," We've got to have some sort of agreement, not by writing a contract or because I'll  fire you if you try to kill yourself, but because we both sort of have to face the fact  that to get there, you've got to go through there."
SPEAKER_00,68.78,70.5," And to go through there, you've got to stay alive."
SPEAKER_01,70.601,71.494," Okay, I'll make you a deal."
SPEAKER_00,71.942,72.472," Okay, what?"
SPEAKER_01,72.86,76.833," You guarantee that you can get, you can help me, and I'll guarantee I'll look at myself."
SPEAKER_00,78.78,79.853, What are you going to do if I fail?
SPEAKER_01,81.732,82.156," Well, then..."
SPEAKER_00,82.54,83.213, If I break my...
SPEAKER_01,83.662,84.54, All bets are off.
SPEAKER_00,84.764,85.152, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,85.861,87.939," So if I don't help you, you'll kill yourself?"
SPEAKER_01,88.142,88.285, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,89.02,90.091," Okay, but if I do help you, you won't?"
SPEAKER_01,94.408,94.857, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,96.03,96.515, I think so.
SPEAKER_01,97.673,98.02," I mean, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,98.705,100.839," If you can help me, no, I won't kill myself."
SPEAKER_00,101.102,101.387, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,102.02,103.273, Then how long are you going to give me to try?
SPEAKER_01,107.102,107.714," Well, I don't know."
