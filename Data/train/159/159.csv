SPEAKER_01, Yep.,15.418,15.52
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so let's talk about that a little bit.",16.685,18.655
SPEAKER_00, What day did that happen on?,19.84,20.752
SPEAKER_01, Tuesday.,21.32,21.769
SPEAKER_00, Tuesday?,22.32,22.565
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut?",23.4,28.937
SPEAKER_01, Where I usually always am at school.,32.008,34.056
SPEAKER_01, I was at my locker.,35.2,36.049
SPEAKER_01, And that stupid girl.,38.545,40.03
SPEAKER_00, What was going on at your locker?,43.16,44.224
SPEAKER_01, Melanie was talking about Tim.,48.94,52.237
SPEAKER_01, My Tim.,52.861,53.308
SPEAKER_01, My boyfriend.,54.16,54.854
SPEAKER_01, And I know it was my Tim she was talking about.,55.682,58.595
SPEAKER_01, I just wanted to punch her so bad.,59.98,63.238
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so you were standing at your locker and you heard somebody say something about  Tim that you didn't want to hear.",64.223,70.095
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, she was talking about him and he didn't text me the night before.",70.9,77.617
SPEAKER_01, So who knows what's going on.,78.98,80.537
SPEAKER_00, What were you feeling right then?,81.724,82.97
SPEAKER_01, So angry.,85.02,85.687
SPEAKER_01, So angry.,87.02,87.714
SPEAKER_00," On a scale of one to ten, how angry would you say you were?",88.161,92.217
SPEAKER_01, Like a nine.,92.82,93.351
SPEAKER_00, Pretty angry then.,94.163,94.97
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,96.241,97.48
SPEAKER_00, What did you do right then?,97.5,98.466
SPEAKER_00, You were at your locker.,100.74,101.516
SPEAKER_00, What's the next thing you did after you heard it?,102.101,103.587
SPEAKER_01," Next thing I did, I slammed my locker.",106.94,109.631
SPEAKER_01, Then I walked down to the gym.,111.96,113.009
SPEAKER_01, But what I wanted to do was push her or punch her.,114.26,116.109
SPEAKER_00, So I know that the gym is usually the place where you cut.,118.32,121.156
SPEAKER_00, Because you said you can go behind the bleachers.,121.981,123.897
SPEAKER_00, People don't usually see you there.,124.18,125.249
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,126.46,126.746
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so where between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym, where  did you decide to cut?",127.46,135.411
SPEAKER_00, Because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody.,136.58,138.435
SPEAKER_00," There must have been a point where you decided, I'm going to cut.",139.04,141.447
SPEAKER_01," I think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought, I can't punch her.",146.1,150.74
SPEAKER_01, I'm going to get in trouble.,150.78,151.691
SPEAKER_01, I'm going to go cut.,152.561,153.229
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,154.609,154.875
SPEAKER_00, So that was when you decided to cut.,155.503,156.933
SPEAKER_00, You went down to the gym.,157.86,158.765
SPEAKER_00, What happened when you got there?,161.58,162.527
SPEAKER_01," Well, nobody was there because gym class isn't in the morning.",165.562,169.074
SPEAKER_01, So I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym.,171.241,175.717
SPEAKER_01, So I went behind the bleachers.,176.66,178.165
SPEAKER_00, What did you use to cut?,182.58,183.383
SPEAKER_01, The pencil that I have always used.,187.18,191.139
SPEAKER_00, It's the same pencil as usual?,191.643,193.196
SPEAKER_00, The one with the metal tip?,194.16,194.726
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,196.14,196.426
SPEAKER_00," Okay, that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of.",198.043,201.975
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I know.",205.345,206.468
SPEAKER_01," It's just, it's my favorite pencil.",210.94,214.314
SPEAKER_01, I use it for school.,215.96,216.945
SPEAKER_01, And it's my favorite pencil.,220.423,221.697
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so you still had the pencil.",222.602,224.015
SPEAKER_00, You got under the bleachers.,224.54,225.599
SPEAKER_00, You said you were feeling angry still.,225.72,229.22
SPEAKER_00, Were you still on the scale of one to ten?,229.361,232.239
SPEAKER_00," Where were you, when you got under the bleachers?",232.42,235.39
SPEAKER_01," I was still at like, I was still pretty high, maybe like an eight and a half though because  I knew I was going to cut.",238.7,246.636
SPEAKER_01, So it like came down a little bit.,247.3,248.991
SPEAKER_00, What were you thinking at that point?,250.5,251.83
SPEAKER_01," Well, I thought a couple things.",256.088,257.251
SPEAKER_01, I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil.,260.94,262.447
SPEAKER_01, And that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly.,265.5,276.016
SPEAKER_00, So you have your pencil.,278.46,279.336
SPEAKER_00, Where did you cut?,279.58,280.192
SPEAKER_01, On my leg.,281.087,281.533
SPEAKER_00, How many times?,282.1,282.649
SPEAKER_01, Three.,283.3,283.402
SPEAKER_00, How deep did you cut?,284.3,285.213
SPEAKER_00, Was it deep enough that you needed a band-aid?,285.66,288.139
SPEAKER_00, Did you need more than a band-aid?,288.24,289.935
SPEAKER_01," No, I mean, I guess I could have used a band-aid, but I mean, whatever.",292.545,297.577
SPEAKER_00, But it wasn't so deep that you needed something more?,298.9,300.713
SPEAKER_01, No.,301.904,302.027
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,303.251,303.7
SPEAKER_00," Right after you cut, where were you on the scale of one to ten with your anger?",304.58,308.816
SPEAKER_01, Like a three.,309.98,310.449
SPEAKER_00, Three?,310.98,311.184
SPEAKER_00, What were you thinking right afterwards?,312.161,313.525
SPEAKER_01, That felt good.,317.62,318.123
SPEAKER_01, I feel better.,320.94,321.484
SPEAKER_01, And I'm going to have to talk to Michelle about this.,324.3,327.17
SPEAKER_00, Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day?,330.26,331.791
SPEAKER_01, The feeling better?,333.12,333.726
SPEAKER_01," Um, yeah, for the most part.",336.345,338.915
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it did.",342.088,343.052
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so that's what happened right afterwards.",346.467,348.495
SPEAKER_00," Later in the day, what were you thinking about the cutting?",349.681,352.715
SPEAKER_01," Well, I kind of forgot about it.",356.769,357.972
SPEAKER_01, But then I just started thinking about it again right before bed.,360.54,365.936
SPEAKER_01, And just feeling really guilty that I cut.,367.701,371.152
SPEAKER_01, Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you.,373.86,375.588
SPEAKER_01," And I just, I mean, in the night time I just constantly think about what happened that  day and then what the next day is going to be like.",378.02,385.719
SPEAKER_01," I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time.",385.86,388.919
SPEAKER_00, I know night is a really difficult time for you.,389.22,391.497
SPEAKER_01," It is, yeah.",391.982,392.513
SPEAKER_00, Everything seems worse at night.,392.88,393.957
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,394.16,394.405
SPEAKER_00, So you were thinking back on it then and you were feeling guilty.,395.521,399.675
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,402.166,402.387
SPEAKER_00, Sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon.,404.72,407.795
SPEAKER_01, No.,408.74,408.821
SPEAKER_01, That always seems to happen.,412.72,413.965
SPEAKER_00," Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while, but it doesn't last.",417.76,421.773
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I guess so.",425.733,426.579
SPEAKER_00, I know you've also been working on doing less cutting.,427.663,430.993
SPEAKER_01, I've been doing pretty good.,433.341,434.415
SPEAKER_00, You have.,434.8,435.106
SPEAKER_00, You've been working really hard.,435.8,437.037
SPEAKER_00," I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last, that you can feel good about  later that you won't have those guilty feelings.",438.143,444.973
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, maybe.",448.872,449.475
SPEAKER_01," I mean, those guilty feelings really suck.",450.7,452.672
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so with the cutting, it sounds like the point where you decided to cut at your  locker.",455.664,462.266
SPEAKER_00, What triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.,463.4,466.874
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,470.035,470.257
SPEAKER_01, Because she's stupid.,471.743,472.572
SPEAKER_00," Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day.",473.782,477.099
SPEAKER_00," You said you hadn't called, you hadn't been texting as much, and that was on your mind.",477.2,481.175
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's right.",482.823,485.058
SPEAKER_00," So I'm wondering if at that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently  next time instead of the cutting.",486.223,493.571
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,496.653,496.935
SPEAKER_00, I'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit.,497.58,500.575
SPEAKER_01, It's not going to bring it down all the way to a three though.,501.52,503.478
SPEAKER_01, I'll tell you that much.,503.741,504.638
SPEAKER_00," It might not, but it'll bring it down a little bit.",504.881,507.436
SPEAKER_00, Maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more.,508.16,510.654
SPEAKER_01, All right.,512.549,512.913
SPEAKER_00, Maybe there'll be things you'll feel good about later.,513.62,515.153
SPEAKER_00, You won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back.,516.0,518.332
SPEAKER_01, All right.,520.909,521.88
SPEAKER_00, So the first thing is that pencil.,521.92,523.695
SPEAKER_00, It sounds like it's comforting to have it.,524.22,525.957
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it is.",527.6,528.573
SPEAKER_00, But it also sounds like it's tempting.,530.5,531.914
SPEAKER_00, What do you think about that?,533.58,534.512
SPEAKER_01," I mean,  only if I am in the mood to cut, it's tempting.",536.901,545.78
SPEAKER_00, Sounds like having that pencil is gonna make it harder  to try other things.,549.54,552.774
SPEAKER_00, And you've been talking about how you're really committed  to not cutting anymore or cutting less.,554.98,559.977
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I am.",561.841,562.613
SPEAKER_00, Sounds like that pencil is standing in your way.,565.88,567.836
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, maybe.",573.481,574.113
SPEAKER_00, What do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time?,579.02,581.658
SPEAKER_00, Choosing a different favorite pencil  that maybe you can't cut with.,583.323,586.355
SPEAKER_01," I mean, maybe, only if it can be like a really cool pencil.",595.56,600.54
SPEAKER_00," That way you can still have something  that can be your favorite, but which won't tempt you.",603.86,607.753
SPEAKER_00, That'll make it easier to try the two things.,608.98,611.437
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,613.226,613.533
SPEAKER_00," Okay, what do you think our first thing should be?",615.581,617.896
SPEAKER_00, What do you think you can try?,618.822,619.751
SPEAKER_00," You just heard somebody say something  you don't wanna hear, you're feeling pretty angry.",620.943,624.357
SPEAKER_00, What can you do in that moment?,624.943,626.058
SPEAKER_01," Well, what I do a lot at home when my mom's bothering me  and saying stuff I don't wanna hear,  I put my headphones on.",627.621,633.858
SPEAKER_00, Do you have your headphones with you at school?,635.241,636.632
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, they actually, they let me keep them on in school.",637.881,641.539
SPEAKER_00, Is that something you'd be willing to try next time?,643.302,644.996
SPEAKER_01," I think so, there's a few songs that usually help me,  so I think so.",647.1,653.712
SPEAKER_00," Okay, that sounds like a good one to try.",654.641,656.577
SPEAKER_00," So we have headphones, we need to come up with one more.",658.06,660.377
SPEAKER_00, What do you think you'd like to try?,661.86,663.396
SPEAKER_01," Well, I really like my teacher, Mrs. Eaton,  so she seems to always kinda be there when I need to talk,  and her room's kinda right down the hallway from my locker,  in the same hallway, so I guess I could talk to her.",666.7,686.22
SPEAKER_00, That sounds like a good option.,689.38,690.494
SPEAKER_00," So that's our goal, is to keep pushing cutting further down the list,  and to keep adding things that you're gonna try  first, and you're right, that the first thing you try  might not bring you all the way down to a two or a three,  but it might bring you down a little bit,  and each thing you try might bring you down  just a little bit more,  so you have to be willing to try a few things.",692.94,713.357
SPEAKER_00, Can you do that?,715.381,715.933
SPEAKER_01," I can, but I really want a cooler pencil, though,  like a cooler pencil, so I don't know,  maybe we could go look for a pencil together?",717.34,727.737
SPEAKER_00, I think that's a good idea.,728.341,729.294
SPEAKER_01," Okay, I'd like that.",732.001,732.892
SPEAKER_00," Okay, thank you for answering all of my questions on this.",733.58,737.08
SPEAKER_00," You did a great job with this chain,  and I know it wasn't easy.",737.14,739.576
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, you're welcome.",741.18,743.115
SPEAKER_00, Let's go look for that pencil.,743.8,744.914
