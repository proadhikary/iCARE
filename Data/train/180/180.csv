SPEAKER_00,32.242,50.259, Well Mr. Smith that's your medication sorted out.
SPEAKER_00,51.22,52.555, Blood pressure is a little on the high side.
SPEAKER_00,55.0,56.272, I wonder if I could raise the subject of your weight.
SPEAKER_01,57.12,57.242, What?
SPEAKER_00,58.301,62.018, I wondered if we could spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight.
SPEAKER_01,62.56,63.532, You are joking aren't you?
SPEAKER_01,64.301,67.698, I mean look I've made time in my day to come here.
SPEAKER_01,68.14,69.691, I'm kept in your waiting room for 45 minutes.
SPEAKER_01,70.92,71.777, It's not acceptable.
SPEAKER_01,72.121,76.222, If I make an appointment with a client for 10 I expect them to start at 10 not quarter  to 11.
SPEAKER_00,77.12,78.554, Right and so you're busy enough.
SPEAKER_01,79.262,80.259, Yeah I've got other things to do.
SPEAKER_01,80.32,81.3, I've got counts to do.
SPEAKER_01,81.34,82.488, I've got clients that are coming in.
SPEAKER_00,84.12,91.62, And it wasn't necessarily easy for you to make the time to come down and you had to  wait in the waiting room and now I raise the subject of weight.
SPEAKER_01,91.64,99.48, Yeah I mean okay fair enough I've got to have my blood pressure medication change but I  really haven't got time to talk about my weight.
SPEAKER_01,99.5,101.48, I mean you know I'm aware of my weight.
SPEAKER_01,101.56,105.075, I'm aware of the problems and I'm also aware of the solutions.
SPEAKER_01,106.3,107.694, So I don't really need a discussion.
SPEAKER_01,108.24,110.656, It's just I've got too much to do at the moment you know.
SPEAKER_00,111.28,111.382, Right.
SPEAKER_00,112.88,114.698, It's been a bit of a rush for you coming in.
SPEAKER_01,114.961,115.165, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,115.92,117.977, And I'm sorry about the weight in the waiting room.
SPEAKER_01,118.724,119.937, It's bad form you know.
SPEAKER_00,120.44,128.798, Yeah that's not easy for you because you'd like to go really soon and here I am asking  you to spend just a couple of minutes with me.
SPEAKER_01,128.96,130.64, Yeah but basically I've got things to do.
SPEAKER_01,130.741,132.078, I've got to get back to the office.
SPEAKER_01,132.28,134.756, I've got a pile of work that I've got to deal with.
SPEAKER_01,135.44,140.499, And every time every moment out of my day means I have to work in the evening or weekends.
SPEAKER_00,140.862,141.229, It counts.
SPEAKER_01,141.821,143.396, Or when you're self-employed you haven't got a choice.
SPEAKER_00,143.78,144.25, Exactly.
SPEAKER_00,144.801,144.944, Exactly.
SPEAKER_00,145.821,146.76, It's up to you.
SPEAKER_00,146.841,148.52, Just a couple of minutes.
SPEAKER_01,148.54,152.019, Well I'm here now so yeah okay if it's a couple of minutes yeah.
SPEAKER_00,152.241,152.567, I promise.
SPEAKER_01,153.22,153.445, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,154.241,155.159, I really must get on.
SPEAKER_00,155.321,157.574, I want to simply ask you how you feel about it.
SPEAKER_01,158.54,159.01, About what?
SPEAKER_01,159.52,159.806, Losing weight?
SPEAKER_01,160.922,162.269, Well obviously I want to.
SPEAKER_01,164.682,165.416, Yeah I mean who doesn't?
SPEAKER_01,165.6,173.42, I mean I'm aware that I'm over my balance weight but I know that it's causing problems.
SPEAKER_01,173.48,179.386, I mean obviously I get out of breath if I have to do something about how I realize that  I'm on this blood pressure.
SPEAKER_01,181.68,183.298, And maybe that's probably contributing to it.
SPEAKER_00,183.561,183.724, Right.
SPEAKER_00,184.52,188.86, So you can see the links between your weight and your health and you'd like things to be  a bit better.
SPEAKER_01,188.96,196.599, Yeah I mean there are other things but I mean yeah the weight is something I would like  to get hold of.
SPEAKER_01,196.721,198.04," You'd get on, get on the handle."
SPEAKER_00,198.06,199.03, You'd like to if you could.
SPEAKER_01,200.04,224.759," Yeah I mean I know the theories of a bit of exercise on a regular basis, a balanced diet  but unfortunately because of my lifestyle, because of being self-employed as an accountant  it's finding the time to exercise but also finding the time to sort of think okay I'm  going to go shopping for this, that and the other."
SPEAKER_01,224.88,225.972, I'm going to prepare a meal.
SPEAKER_01,226.68,229.459, With me it's very often ready meals and that sort of thing.
SPEAKER_01,229.801,232.198," Yeah food on the run, you know, grazing."
SPEAKER_00,232.6,236.335, Let me see if I can summarize what you've said and then we'll see what next.
SPEAKER_00,237.48,238.269, You lead a busy life.
SPEAKER_00,239.3,240.948, You run a business and you've got a lot to do.
SPEAKER_00,243.62,253.498, You're aware of the links between your health and your weight and you are concerned to some  extent about that and ideally it sounds like you'd like to do something about it.
SPEAKER_00,253.98,261.474, It's just that your life is busy and rushed and you tend to use convenience foods in order  to get the work done.
SPEAKER_01,261.92,266.098, Yeah I mean to a certain extent because of my lifestyle food is just fuel.
SPEAKER_00,267.211,267.354, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,267.64,270.078, You know because I'm juggling all these balls and I don't want to drop any.
SPEAKER_00,270.361,271.172," I get it, I get it."
SPEAKER_00,271.74,278.38, And so if you could fit it in you would like things to be different but that's not so easy.
SPEAKER_01,278.705,278.828, No.
SPEAKER_00,279.481,280.44, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,280.44,285.206, Can I suggest that you come back and see me in a couple of weeks time just to chat about  this?
SPEAKER_01,287.865,298.251," Okay, I'm up for that but it's going to be the same problem of A finding time and B if  I make an appointment I don't expect to be kept waiting for half an hour or whatever  because it's..."
SPEAKER_00,299.027,299.313, Exactly.
SPEAKER_00,299.68,304.072, I'll tell you what might be a nice solution is if you come down first appointment and  I give you an appointment at 8.30.
SPEAKER_01,304.68,305.68, That'd be good.
SPEAKER_00,305.92,307.537, Then there'll be absolutely no waiting.
SPEAKER_00,307.86,319.173, And the purpose of that visit will be to have a look at how you really feel about how you  could move forward and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle into the busy work life  that you've got.
SPEAKER_01,319.54,325.655," I'll maybe have a look at my schedules, see whether anything can be arranged or I can  pass something on to some..."
SPEAKER_01,326.161,328.718, And so it's not a wasted interview.
SPEAKER_01,329.0,331.336," So I can come here and say okay I've looked at my schedules, I've looked at things."
SPEAKER_00,331.981,332.144, Good.
SPEAKER_01,333.002,333.512, Whatever.
SPEAKER_00,333.94,334.063, Good.
SPEAKER_00,335.16,336.695, So give some thought to what we've talked about.
SPEAKER_01,337.466,338.099," Yeah, of course."
SPEAKER_01,338.67,339.058, Good stuff.
SPEAKER_00,339.466,339.711, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,340.16,340.895," Okay, thanks."
SPEAKER_01,341.446,342.16, Sorry I went off a bit.
