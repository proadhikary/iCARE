SPEAKER_00, And then maybe then begin to identify some of the emotions that are behind it.,504.783,508.67
SPEAKER_00,"But, you know, you growing up with six siblings, did you, all of you go to the same school?",508.73,513.84

SPEAKER_00, Right.,592.306,592.592
SPEAKER_00, So then you had to make a whole new set of friends.,593.465,594.98
