SPEAKER_01,14.854,15.335, I'm doing alright.
SPEAKER_00,15.355,16.778,How about you?
SPEAKER_00,18.383,20.094, I'm doing well.
SPEAKER_00,20.255,20.879,Thanks for asking.
SPEAKER_00,22.044,25.98, I understand you've had some recent difficulties and that brought you into our agency.
SPEAKER_01,26.802,34.98," Yeah, I'm having some problems with friends and family, relationships I guess in general."
SPEAKER_00,35.143,36.0, Relationships?
SPEAKER_01,36.101,39.859," Yeah, I have a lot of stuff."
SPEAKER_00,40.224,40.939, You have a lot of stuff?
SPEAKER_01,41.162,41.848," Yeah, a lot of stuff."
SPEAKER_00,43.245,43.796, Like where you live?
SPEAKER_01,45.162,56.938," Yeah, my house is full of things and it's kind of embarrassing."
SPEAKER_01,59.082,61.426, I don't like to get rid of things.
SPEAKER_01,63.891,66.536,I worry that I'm going to need them or something.
SPEAKER_01,70.02,73.518," So yeah, it's overflowing my house with stuff."
SPEAKER_00,74.1,81.078, So there's a lot of stuff in your house and this is affecting your relationships?
SPEAKER_01,82.321,88.739," Yeah, you know, all the stuff is taking over my house."
SPEAKER_01,89.0,95.957, There's no room for anyone to really come over and visit me which has really become your problem.
SPEAKER_01,97.321,102.496, You meet people and it's normal to go over to their house and have lunch or whatever.
SPEAKER_01,104.04,105.027, And I get really embarrassed.
SPEAKER_01,105.047,106.094,I don't want people to do that.
SPEAKER_01,107.242,108.973, I don't want my family even coming over.
SPEAKER_01,110.0,114.819, My sister was over last week and she threw something away.
SPEAKER_01,115.541,122.138, She threw this newspaper away from two years ago and I freaked out.
SPEAKER_01,123.984,125.51, What if I need that?
SPEAKER_01,126.775,127.98,Those things are important to me.
SPEAKER_01,128.843,132.94, So that's kind of putting a strain on my relationship with my family in that way.
SPEAKER_01,133.02,141.78, I think they're the only ones probably that would feel brave enough to actually do something like my sister did.
SPEAKER_00,142.303,144.0, To throw something away?
SPEAKER_01,144.061,144.204, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,145.402,149.96," Yeah, so it's embarrassing that I can't have my friends over."
SPEAKER_01,150.06,154.92, What it's like to have my family over and I just can't.
SPEAKER_01,155.04,156.96, I don't know what to do.
SPEAKER_00,157.582,160.793, So you mentioned your house is overflowing.
SPEAKER_00,160.833,163.0,How cluttered can you describe it?
SPEAKER_01,166.273,167.98, There's room for me to live in there.
SPEAKER_01,171.425,180.499," There's a path from my front door to the kitchen, to the bedroom and the bathroom."
SPEAKER_01,181.361,190.86," Sometimes it's blocked by stuff but when things fall or whatever, pretty much my whole house is full of things."
SPEAKER_00,191.945,193.07, What type of things?
SPEAKER_00,193.714,194.799,You mentioned a newspaper.
SPEAKER_01,196.202,204.439," I don't like to get rid of cards or newspapers or magazines, mail, things like that."
SPEAKER_01,205.905,208.397, But I've also collected things over the years.
SPEAKER_01,209.362,212.116, I inherited the house from my grandmother so all her stuff was in there.
SPEAKER_01,213.402,215.048, I really can't get rid of that.
SPEAKER_01,215.129,217.096,It has a lot of sentimental value to me.
SPEAKER_01,220.104,223.977, My things have just been piled up on her things.
SPEAKER_00,226.504,232.779, So you have a lot of stuff in the house and it's congested but you're able to move around and live there.
SPEAKER_01,233.642,238.759," Yeah, I'm not freely able to move around but it works for me."
SPEAKER_00,240.305,243.679, But it'd be difficult or it is difficult when other people come by.
SPEAKER_01,244.321,248.337," Yes, they wouldn't really be able to be in there."
SPEAKER_00,251.242,260.499," Some of these items you said you received when you received the house, do you ever go out and buy things and bring them in?"
SPEAKER_01,261.803,263.227," Yeah, I like to go shopping."
SPEAKER_01,263.247,266.86,I like to get the yard sales on the weekends.
SPEAKER_01,267.782,273.819, I'm kind of a deal hunter so if I see something on sale I don't want to pass it up.
SPEAKER_01,274.622,276.892, If it's a good deal I might not be able to come back to it.
SPEAKER_01,277.012,278.96,I do like to buy things.
SPEAKER_00,279.364,280.475, How often do you buy things?
SPEAKER_01,282.744,286.993," I probably like, on the weekends I go to yard sales."
SPEAKER_01,287.073,290.0,I usually buy a few things every weekend from yard sales.
SPEAKER_01,290.341,291.543, They're such good deals.
SPEAKER_01,292.825,299.195,I make a trip to the mall or DJ Maxx once a week at least.
SPEAKER_01,300.057,301.579,So I usually buy something then too.
SPEAKER_00,303.266,305.176, Does your vehicle have stuff in it now that you bought?
SPEAKER_01,307.342,313.452," Yes, I actually picked something up that I saw that was for sale on the side of the road on the way here."
SPEAKER_01,313.472,317.199,It was a little bedside table.
SPEAKER_01,318.02,320.734, So it was only a few bucks so it was fun.
SPEAKER_00,322.942,329.396," Alright, so you have some things you buy, you have some things that you otherwise obtain that are in the house."
SPEAKER_00,329.878,330.559,They're already there.
SPEAKER_01,331.122,331.51, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,332.621,336.189, And you have trouble parting with them.
SPEAKER_00,336.45,340.94,Have you ever tried to throw anything out or give anything away?
SPEAKER_01,342.384,347.539, People have suggested that I do that but I just can't bring myself to do that.
SPEAKER_01,348.942,351.927," My sister came over, she tried to give her something for me."
SPEAKER_01,351.947,356.536,I couldn't do it.
SPEAKER_01,358.098,358.659,It's too hard.
SPEAKER_00,359.755,359.918, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,360.601,361.643, I just think I might need it.
SPEAKER_01,361.944,362.806,What if I need it?
SPEAKER_01,362.826,367.735,What if I want to look back and reference that newspaper that she tried to throw away?
SPEAKER_01,367.756,368.778,I won't have it.
SPEAKER_00,370.662,374.575, So what would you like to gain from counseling?
SPEAKER_01,377.282,380.388, I would like to be able to get rid of things.
SPEAKER_01,380.448,385.998,I would like not to worry so much when I do or when someone wants me to.
SPEAKER_01,387.921,390.465, So I can kind of gain relationships with people.
SPEAKER_01,391.767,395.974,People don't really like to come over.
SPEAKER_01,396.034,397.035,I mean they don't like to come over.
SPEAKER_01,397.055,398.217,I don't like them to come over.
SPEAKER_01,400.24,406.709," It kind of puts a strain on relationships, especially dating relationships."
SPEAKER_01,408.511,409.933,I don't want to tell people about it.
SPEAKER_01,409.953,411.435,I don't want people to see that.
SPEAKER_01,411.796,412.817,That's embarrassing to me.
SPEAKER_01,415.16,421.797," So significant others kind of think that's weird and that kind of, I think I'm shady because I don't want them to come over."
SPEAKER_01,421.817,423.0,I have something to hide or something.
SPEAKER_01,423.462,426.795, I mean I do but they don't know that's what it is.
SPEAKER_00,428.621,432.247, So you'd like to be able to throw things out?
SPEAKER_01,432.727,433.589,Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,433.629,436.733,"Clear out your... Yeah, a little bit at a time."
SPEAKER_01,436.753,440.86,I don't think it's going to happen right away but I'd like to get there eventually.
