SPEAKER_00,14.218,15.24," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."
SPEAKER_00,15.681,17.234, I hope you find this video useful.
SPEAKER_00,17.96,20.956," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_00,21.76,23.145," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,27.76,28.954, So when you have...
SPEAKER_00,29.48,30.452, So let's talk about this.
SPEAKER_00,31.1,37.987," So those type of thoughts, like I can't make a mistake or something like that, we call  those automatic thoughts."
SPEAKER_00,39.8,44.657, And we'll have plenty of time to talk about the different structures in CBT.
SPEAKER_00,45.5,50.34," I do want to explain it to you, but over the course of several sessions."
SPEAKER_00,50.38,52.632, Let's just take pieces of it for now.
SPEAKER_00,54.04,65.498, So what we believe is that your beliefs combine with the situation and create these thoughts.
SPEAKER_00,66.92,72.733," So you have this belief, so you're laying in bed before work, and you have this belief  that you're maybe not competent."
SPEAKER_00,73.781,78.016," And then the situation that combines with that is, it's time to go to work."
SPEAKER_00,79.0,85.617, So the stress of it being time to actually get up and get ready and go to work.
SPEAKER_00,86.92,90.992, And then you have an automatic thought in that moment.
SPEAKER_00,93.74,97.093, And right now it's one tied to dread and fear.
SPEAKER_00,98.88,101.199, Let's try to identify an exact one for this example.
SPEAKER_00,101.32,103.269, So let's use that scenario.
SPEAKER_00,105.46,107.591, You believe that you might not be competent.
SPEAKER_00,109.32,111.995, You're laying in bed and the alarm clock goes off.
SPEAKER_00,112.96,116.637," So you're kind of pressured to make a decision about, do I get ready for work or not?"
SPEAKER_00,117.34,118.108, What's the thought right then?
SPEAKER_01,119.34,121.755," If I go to work, I'm going to make a mistake."
SPEAKER_00,122.56,125.039, Going to make a mistake.
SPEAKER_00,125.18,127.613," So if I go, I'm going to make a mistake."
SPEAKER_00,128.88,134.556," And then we talked about your reactions, being late, worry, anxiety."
SPEAKER_00,136.12,143.244, So what we like to do when we identify an automatic thought like that is what's called  self-talk.
SPEAKER_00,146.385,147.918, And at first this may seem a little odd.
SPEAKER_00,148.603,151.18, So you have this thought that comes through.
SPEAKER_00,151.18,155.596," It can be an image too, a thought, image, but it's cognitive in nature."
SPEAKER_00,158.386,159.234, I can't make a mistake.
SPEAKER_00,160.125,160.937, I'm going to make a mistake.
SPEAKER_00,161.16,161.936, I'm going to make a mistake.
SPEAKER_00,162.16,162.604, That's your thought.
SPEAKER_00,164.54,177.416," And the self-talk, this is like a rehearsed statement that you literally say to yourself,  which again, I get that seems a little odd the first time I do it."
SPEAKER_00,178.26,180.09, So really you're talking to yourself.
SPEAKER_00,182.822,196.975," But over time, we believe if you can keep applying the self-talk strategy, that you  will eventually change the outcome, the reaction, and change the underlying belief."
SPEAKER_00,199.38,203.134," At first though, it's going to seem quite foreign to you."
SPEAKER_00,205.523,207.714, Tell me how you're processing this now in terms of...
SPEAKER_01,209.061,212.437," So, I mean, what am I supposed to say to myself, I guess?"
SPEAKER_00,213.0,213.605, That's a good question.
SPEAKER_00,215.26,216.868," We'll work on that, and that's what we can do now."
SPEAKER_00,219.1,225.296," Let's take a look at some self-talk, some adaptive responses that we can build."
SPEAKER_00,227.02,230.491, So I'm going to make a mistake.
SPEAKER_00,233.141,234.054, That's the automatic thought.
SPEAKER_00,234.5,243.983," What's directly leading, seems to be, to feelings of worry, dread, and physically not getting  to work on time?"
SPEAKER_00,247.06,252.102," Have there ever been times when you've had that thought, and you went to work on time  still?"
SPEAKER_01,253.592,253.817, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,254.102,254.327, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,255.423,256.751, What was different about those times?
SPEAKER_01,258.38,264.148," I guess I told myself I have to get to work on time, because if I don't, it's going to  be even worse."
SPEAKER_01,265.3,273.578," If I make a mistake and I'm late, then it just compounds, and I guess I would tell myself  it's going to be okay."
SPEAKER_01,273.7,275.431, You just have to get through this day.
SPEAKER_00,280.37,284.26," Alright, so when you do that, in essence, you are applying self-talk."
SPEAKER_01,284.301,284.423, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,285.546,285.872, Alright?
SPEAKER_00,286.441,290.135," So that's really the same thing, except you probably didn't have a label for it."
SPEAKER_00,291.5,292.767," And when you apply that, it seems to work."
SPEAKER_00,295.1,303.311," So the message you're kind of sending yourself now, you're telling yourself is, I'm going  to make a mistake still, but if I'm late for work, it'll be worse."
SPEAKER_00,305.82,307.455, So there's a little bit of positive and negative in the...
SPEAKER_01,307.98,308.123, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,308.98,309.062, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,311.354,311.98, That's okay.
SPEAKER_00,311.98,312.245, Right?
SPEAKER_00,313.181,317.617, Self-talk doesn't have to be all positive.
SPEAKER_00,318.42,322.29," Self-talk needs to be, I think more than anything, realistic."
SPEAKER_00,327.183,329.816, And sometimes realistic includes a little negativity.
SPEAKER_00,331.021,335.497," I'd rather focus on the more positive elements as we build this as possible, though."
SPEAKER_00,336.38,340.316, So that's pretty good self-talk you have now.
SPEAKER_00,341.46,345.6, Let's work on refining it a little bit to maximize its benefit.
