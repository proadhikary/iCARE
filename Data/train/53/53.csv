SPEAKER_00,14.679,15.56," Hi Carly, how are you doing today?"
SPEAKER_01,16.029,16.254, I'm good.
SPEAKER_01,16.642,17.05, How about you?
SPEAKER_00,17.762,18.85," I'm doing well, thanks for asking."
SPEAKER_00,20.04,20.929, How did you do this week?
SPEAKER_01,22.816,23.04, Better.
SPEAKER_00,23.04,23.224, Better?
SPEAKER_01,25.245,26.771," Well, last time we talked about the..."
SPEAKER_00,28.84,29.82, The postpone graphication?
SPEAKER_01,29.86,30.595," Yeah, that."
SPEAKER_01,32.908,35.258, And I think you wanted 10 minutes for me to put it off?
SPEAKER_00,35.84,36.33," 10 minutes, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,36.84,39.049, So I did better.
SPEAKER_01,41.76,46.799, I think I ended up only doing like a joint and a half instead of two.
SPEAKER_01,47.1,62.692, I was able to put it off for I think the 10 minutes a couple times and then there was  I think one or two days where I went out for a walk because I was tired of staring  at the clock waiting for the 10 minutes to pass.
SPEAKER_01,63.76,73.855," So I got up, went for a walk and then I passed one of my friends so I ended up walking with  her and I actually didn't get back to my house for like an hour."
SPEAKER_01,75.6,79.213, So I kind of put it off for like an hour because then I came home and took a couple hits.
SPEAKER_00,81.1,88.72, So it sounds like you were able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana at least.
SPEAKER_01,88.76,89.209, It was rough.
SPEAKER_00,89.862,90.474, It was rough?
SPEAKER_01,91.25,91.678, It was rough.
SPEAKER_01,91.78,92.025, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,93.804,97.797, So it was difficult for you but in most cases you're able to hold off the 10 minutes.
SPEAKER_00,99.001,106.097, And it sounds like there was a few instances where you're able to hold it off longer because  something else kind of came up.
SPEAKER_01,106.786,106.949, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,107.56,112.485, I actually talked to a couple people on the phone and before I knew it like a half hour  had gone by.
SPEAKER_00,114.44,121.955, So another activity presented itself and you forgot about the marijuana?
SPEAKER_01,124.4,124.665, Kind of.
SPEAKER_00,125.42,125.686, Yeah?
SPEAKER_01,126.645,126.747, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,127.702,129.109, I guess I just wasn't thinking about it.
SPEAKER_00,131.661,136.64, So has your feelings about marijuana changed since we last talked?
SPEAKER_01,136.903,137.515," No, not really."
SPEAKER_00,137.983,138.511, Tell me about that.
SPEAKER_01,139.2,142.775, I mean I don't see it as a problem.
SPEAKER_01,143.96,149.195, It's legal in a lot of states now and I mean it's not that bad for you.
SPEAKER_01,151.04,155.417, It doesn't really endanger me much.
SPEAKER_00,157.344,162.62, So you still believe you should have the right to smoke marijuana?
SPEAKER_01,163.191,163.436, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,163.64,164.967, I mean I'm not hurting anybody else.
SPEAKER_00,167.36,178.272," But at the same time you want to go back to work and if I remember right, you're the person  that you could go work for."
SPEAKER_00,179.121,180.039," I guess you know them, right?"
SPEAKER_01,180.1,180.958," Yeah, it's my uncle."
SPEAKER_00,181.284,181.713, Your uncle.
SPEAKER_00,182.442,184.615," And you need to be clean for, what is it, about two months?"
SPEAKER_01,185.481,187.151," Yeah, I think two to three months."
SPEAKER_00,188.881,191.98," So you have kind of opposing forces here, right?"
SPEAKER_00,192.0,200.457," You have your enjoyment of the marijuana and then you, you know, that's something you  like, you don't want to give up and you believe you should have a right to do that."
SPEAKER_00,201.706,202.613, But then there's that job.
SPEAKER_01,204.504,208.098," Yeah, I mean my parents are pretty cool with it."
SPEAKER_01,208.7,214.789, They know but I mean I'm at the point now where they kind of want me to move on and  move out.
SPEAKER_01,216.468,217.98, But I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,218.0,221.038, I mean it'd be nice to have that job.
SPEAKER_01,222.022,229.11, I think it's a really good job but at the same time like I don't see why I have to sacrifice  something that I like.
SPEAKER_00,229.96,234.499, So it doesn't seem fair to you but you recognize it's the reality of your situation.
SPEAKER_01,234.801,235.066, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,235.76,240.399, So it really does come down in your instance to marijuana use or employment.
SPEAKER_01,241.605,242.851," Yeah, it's pretty accurate."
SPEAKER_00,244.761,250.158, So you're not happy about that choice.
SPEAKER_01,251.082,254.02, Not at all.
SPEAKER_00,254.04,264.649," And kind of what we did with the postponed gratification was just, I mean I really just  asked you to wait 10 minutes and you were able to do that and more, although it was  difficult."
SPEAKER_01,265.241,265.894, It was difficult.
SPEAKER_00,266.383,267.377, It was difficult for you.
SPEAKER_00,267.781,273.477, So I asked you to track the number of times you smoked marijuana.
SPEAKER_00,274.36,276.218, Were you able to track that over the last week?
SPEAKER_01,276.602,277.617," Yeah, for the most part."
SPEAKER_00,277.981,279.207, Do you remember how many times that was?
SPEAKER_01,281.981,287.494," I think I did like 15, 15, 15, and 20."
SPEAKER_00,290.301,290.686, Between 15 and 20.
SPEAKER_00,291.8,293.899, And how many times did something kind of get in the way?
SPEAKER_00,294.0,298.974, Did something else come up in that 10 minute span that distracted you or that you enjoyed?
SPEAKER_01,300.88,303.378, I would say 10.
SPEAKER_01,305.329,307.118, Like almost closer to 20 times I guess.
SPEAKER_01,307.6,311.031, Otherwise I probably would have kept going and smoked more.
SPEAKER_01,313.66,321.01, I mean there were a couple times where somebody would call me or somebody would text me and  that kind of distracted me.
SPEAKER_01,322.281,323.448, So I would have put it off for a little bit.
SPEAKER_00,325.24,329.079, So you can see in that 10 minutes things can happen.
SPEAKER_00,330.523,334.276, Things can happen that can help you to avoid the marijuana.
SPEAKER_00,335.28,349.41," Sometimes nothing does and after the 10 minutes you use it and sometimes something does kind  of get in the way with the marijuana, like distract you or you have another activity  that you enjoy and then you didn't use."
SPEAKER_00,351.68,358.38," So with that in mind, you found the experience rough but was it tolerable?"
SPEAKER_01,359.468,360.153," Yeah, it wasn't bad."
SPEAKER_00,361.08,361.383, Was it bad?
SPEAKER_00,362.88,369.673, Do you think for this next week we could try postponing that gratification from 10 minutes  to 20 minutes?
SPEAKER_01,371.993,372.88, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,372.92,375.957," That seems kind of, that seems like a longer time."
SPEAKER_00,376.56,378.636," That is definitely, that is a longer time."
SPEAKER_01,379.261,380.008, I don't know about that.
SPEAKER_01,381.72,383.431, Maybe like 15 minutes.
SPEAKER_00,384.72,385.589, You want to compromise at 15?
SPEAKER_01,386.781,386.944, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,387.72,390.7," You think you could maintain 15 minutes, weigh 15?"
SPEAKER_01,390.821,393.237, I think I could try a little bit more than 20.
SPEAKER_01,393.902,395.094, It would be a little easier than 20.
SPEAKER_00,395.801,397.377," Alright, so let's go with 15 minutes."
SPEAKER_00,398.041,409.519," So 15 minutes as compared to 10, that will give you 5 extra minutes that something could  happen that could distract you and you wouldn't use in that instance, right?"
SPEAKER_00,410.882,419.25," There's also, you know, to constructively use that time, you could consider alternatives  like you mentioned walking, right?"
SPEAKER_00,421.56,423.953, You could use that time and start walking.
SPEAKER_01,425.669,425.873, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,426.628,427.036, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,427.561,437.839," Anything else that you, like maybe in the past on occasion when you wanted to use marijuana  but you didn't have anything available, what would you do instead, if anything?"
SPEAKER_01,439.992,440.659, Binge watch TV.
SPEAKER_00,440.76,441.76, Watch TV?
SPEAKER_00,441.923,442.127, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,443.502,454.539," Well, so perhaps in that 15 minute time period, that time you're delaying using marijuana,  you could start watching a show that you like?"
SPEAKER_01,454.901,455.932," Yeah, I could do that."
SPEAKER_00,457.463,463.114," At the end of 15 minutes, you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue  watching the show."
SPEAKER_00,465.246,466.998, So do you see kind of how it works?
SPEAKER_00,467.843,470.375," Like is it making sense to you, the postponing?"
SPEAKER_01,471.3,473.978," Yeah, it doesn't make it any easier but..."
SPEAKER_00,474.401,475.108," It's tough for you, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,476.3,476.423, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,477.28,479.555," No, I definitely see how it helps."
SPEAKER_00,482.441,488.28," And maybe if we're successful with the 15, who knows, we could move it up from there."
SPEAKER_01,488.811,489.076, Maybe.
SPEAKER_01,489.341,490.076, We'll see how the 15 goes.
SPEAKER_00,490.341,491.28," We'll see how it goes with the 15, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,491.32,492.351, We'll see how that goes.
SPEAKER_00,493.86,505.557," You know, I'm hoping, and I hope this kind of makes sense, that there'll be a point where  you'll be really interfering with the vast majority of the times that you use marijuana."
SPEAKER_00,506.8,510.153, Because you're giving yourself that many more opportunities the longer you wait.
SPEAKER_00,512.504,516.045," The more minutes you wait, the more opportunities for something else to get in the way, so to  speak."
SPEAKER_00,517.741,529.395," And probably what you'll see, just like you saw this last week, is you used marijuana  less frequently just by waiting the 10 minutes."
SPEAKER_00,531.063,537.652," Even though you describe it as difficult, and I'm sure it was, but there were a few  times where it kind of worked out."
SPEAKER_01,539.461,539.704, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,541.32,545.32, So I think that planning something for that time would be helpful.
SPEAKER_00,546.082,547.82, Try to plan something for 15 minutes.
SPEAKER_00,548.322,553.476," Even if you fully intend at the end of the 15 to go right and use, I think it's still  useful to plan something in there."
SPEAKER_00,554.464,556.78, And you never know what all that might take you.
SPEAKER_00,556.84,564.416, You might end up walking or watching TV or doing something else that would distract you  or pull you away from the marijuana use.
SPEAKER_01,565.024,565.187, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,565.84,567.315, So does that sound like a plan?
SPEAKER_01,567.86,569.274," Yeah, I think I can give that a try."
SPEAKER_00,569.962,570.33, Good.
SPEAKER_00,571.36,583.033," I think it would be the same thing if you could kind of write down the number of times  that you used, like mark each time you used, and kind of what happened in terms of the  15 minute wait."
SPEAKER_01,583.523,583.727, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,584.911,585.033, Right.
SPEAKER_00,585.36,591.315," Actually, I guess more accurately, every time that you initiate a 15 minute wait period  would be a good time to note it."
SPEAKER_01,591.86,592.431, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,592.86,601.498," Right, because the idea is that something's going to come up and that you're going to  have an opportunity to distance yourself from the use and you won't use as much."
SPEAKER_00,602.321,616.277," So I want to kind of get an idea of the thought process that's occurring as you start that  15 minute, right, and if you end up using, what happened then, if you end up not using,  kind of like the outcome for each possible scenario."
SPEAKER_00,616.921,617.084, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,618.104,618.349, Right.
SPEAKER_00,618.981,622.337, And then we can kind of analyze that and we can see if moving the minutes up would be
SPEAKER_00,622.9,623.88, something we could do.
SPEAKER_01,624.166,624.309, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,625.166,625.88, Does that sound like a plan?
SPEAKER_01,625.88,626.88," Yeah, I think I can manage that."
SPEAKER_00,626.9,627.247, All right.
SPEAKER_00,628.464,630.256, We'll go with that and I'll see you in a week.
SPEAKER_01,631.165,631.349, Okay.
