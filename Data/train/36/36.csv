SPEAKER_00,369.222,371.0," How about once you fall asleep, do you stay asleep?"

SPEAKER_01,384.143,384.985, What am I forgetting?
SPEAKER_01,385.005,391.0,"So I just always feel like there's something always on my mind that just makes it, if I'm asleep, I can't stay asleep because I wake up thinking about it, and I can't go back to sleep."
