SPEAKER_00,14.898,15.739," Hi Jason, how are you doing today?"
SPEAKER_01,16.787,17.113, I'm here.
SPEAKER_00,17.603,17.909, You're good?
SPEAKER_01,19.147,20.319," I'm here, that's all I can say."
SPEAKER_01,20.624,21.195, I'm just here.
SPEAKER_00,21.44,22.42, You're here?
SPEAKER_01,22.44,22.501, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,24.426,25.089, What's been going on?
SPEAKER_01,26.92,41.159," So I've been made to come in and talk to you because something happened on the bus and  I might have said something to somebody and they're just like, oh you can't say that."
SPEAKER_01,41.32,43.715," So they actually said, Doug, we're going to take you to jail."
SPEAKER_01,44.44,45.529, From jail they just called me here.
SPEAKER_00,46.98,49.239, Do you know what you're charged with?
SPEAKER_01,50.268,51.439, They didn't explain anything.
SPEAKER_01,51.52,53.115, The government never explains anything.
SPEAKER_01,53.6,57.448, They just don't want me to understand what's going on because they just want to keep me  held in captivity.
SPEAKER_00,58.72,59.189, The government?
SPEAKER_00,59.72,60.598, Do you have anybody specific?
SPEAKER_01,61.687,63.178," No, it's the entire government."
SPEAKER_00,63.4,64.033, The entire government?
SPEAKER_01,64.4,65.4, The entire government.
SPEAKER_00,66.143,70.078, And how long have they been wanting to do this to you?
SPEAKER_01,70.52,71.071, All my life.
SPEAKER_01,71.943,73.089, They've done this all my life.
SPEAKER_01,74.88,77.772," They're always listening, they're always around, they're always there."
SPEAKER_00,79.904,80.679, Always there?
SPEAKER_01,80.74,81.251, Always there.
SPEAKER_01,82.045,83.1," Like for example, they're in the lights right now."
SPEAKER_01,83.1,91.992, They're listening to everything that we're talking about so that's the reason why I really  want to talk about what happened on the bus because they're just going to use that again  today and then it's going to lock me up again and make me take more minutes.
SPEAKER_00,93.72,95.033, You've been taking medications?
SPEAKER_01,97.826,112.248," Yes, I take the medication because if I don't take the medication, the government comes  and takes me away and puts me into a hospital where they force feed me the medication and  then the lights are always on and they can always hear everything that I'm saying and  what I'm thinking and what I'm going to do."
SPEAKER_00,114.96,118.035, Do you know what they want to do with that information?
SPEAKER_01,119.967,121.517, They want to use it to take over the world.
SPEAKER_00,122.184,122.858, To take over the world?
SPEAKER_01,123.041,124.173," To take over the world, of course."
SPEAKER_01,124.76,136.474, They want to use everything and use everything that everybody knows to use it against them  so that they can actually have the world that they want and that they need and make everybody  pretend that they don't know what's going on.
SPEAKER_01,137.38,144.747, So therefore they're using everybody's thoughts against themselves so that the government  can use it to their benefit.
SPEAKER_00,147.36,151.179, So what can you do in this situation?
SPEAKER_01,153.39,153.973, What do you mean?
SPEAKER_01,154.033,154.717,What can I do?
SPEAKER_00,155.36,160.188," Well, you said the government's monitoring everything and that they want to put you in  jail."
SPEAKER_01,161.494,161.698, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,161.8,165.56," If you don't take your medication, do you have any options?"
SPEAKER_00,165.66,166.247, Are you stuck?
SPEAKER_01,167.503,167.666, No.
SPEAKER_01,168.46,177.825," When I'm home, I think I'm perfectly fine because I set up my house and my room to actually  make it government-approved so that nobody can actually hear or see what's going on in  there."
SPEAKER_01,178.56,180.776," So when I'm home, I'm perfectly fine."
SPEAKER_00,181.36,184.259, So one option is that being home.
SPEAKER_01,184.48,185.153," Being home, you're safe."
SPEAKER_01,185.48,186.296," Being home, I'm safe."
SPEAKER_01,186.929,187.378," Being home, I'm safe."
SPEAKER_01,187.48,187.888, My mom's safe.
SPEAKER_01,188.786,189.439, My brother's safe.
SPEAKER_01,189.684,190.337, Everybody's safe.
SPEAKER_01,191.344,193.756," And being out in the world, I'm not safe."
SPEAKER_01,194.623,195.174, Nobody's safe.
SPEAKER_00,195.803,197.46, Are you safe here?
SPEAKER_01,198.498,198.6, No.
SPEAKER_01,199.483,205.335, I told you they are in the light and they can hear everything that we're saying right  now.
SPEAKER_01,205.6,206.731," So no, we're not safe here."
SPEAKER_00,208.752,209.6, So it's not safe here.
SPEAKER_00,209.6,210.6, It's not safe out in the world.
SPEAKER_00,210.6,211.518," At home, you're safe."
SPEAKER_01,212.222,215.655," At home, I'm safe in my room that I made government-approved."
SPEAKER_00,216.84,222.399," So if you could have your way, you would just stay home most of the time, all the time?"
SPEAKER_01,222.66,227.38," I would stay home all of the time, but I can't stay home because I need to go and see doctors."
SPEAKER_01,228.4,232.34, And talk to people and do things that the government needs me or wants me to do.
SPEAKER_01,232.48,239.997, But I don't want to do those things because it's using my thoughts and they're trying  to use everybody against me.
SPEAKER_01,240.761,242.629, And I just can't deal with that.
SPEAKER_00,245.46,248.34, So how do you know that they're in the lights?
SPEAKER_00,249.165,250.071, How did you discover that?
SPEAKER_01,252.145,253.635, Everybody knows that they're in the lights.
SPEAKER_00,254.543,255.4, It's common knowledge?
SPEAKER_01,255.42,256.216, It's common knowledge.
SPEAKER_00,258.323,263.687, Do you ever hear things that other people can't hear or see things that other people  can't see?
SPEAKER_01,265.471,265.996," No, of course."
SPEAKER_01,266.36,268.219, Everybody hears the lights talking to you.
SPEAKER_01,268.441,269.754, I don't know what you're talking about.
SPEAKER_01,270.38,271.39," Like, everybody hears it."
SPEAKER_01,272.36,273.36, Sometimes it's a whisper for some people.
SPEAKER_01,273.605,274.34, Sometimes it's a yell.
SPEAKER_01,274.4,281.36," And if you want to not pay attention to what the lights are saying to you, then I don't  know what's wrong with you, but everybody can hear it."
SPEAKER_00,281.748,282.34, Everybody can hear it?
SPEAKER_01,282.523,283.115, Everybody can.
SPEAKER_00,283.36,284.34, What's it sound like to you?
SPEAKER_01,285.421,287.219, It just sounds like a robot talking.
SPEAKER_01,288.385,291.159, It sounds like we need to know this information.
SPEAKER_01,291.32,291.749, We need to...
SPEAKER_01,292.643,294.138, What are you doing?
SPEAKER_00,294.34,295.411," Oh, just making some notes."
SPEAKER_00,297.546,299.777, Just making some progress notes.
SPEAKER_00,301.472,301.936, Is it working?
SPEAKER_01,304.422,304.667, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,306.025,307.192, Where are your notes going to go?
SPEAKER_00,309.365,312.139," Well, this chart will get locked in the chart room down the hall."
SPEAKER_01,313.442,314.27, Who has access to the chart room?
SPEAKER_00,316.126,317.213, Mostly everybody works here.
SPEAKER_01,318.623,318.987, Oh.
SPEAKER_01,320.984,323.396, Can I get a copy of your notes after you're done?
SPEAKER_00,325.007,326.28, Does it worry that there's notes?
SPEAKER_01,326.722,336.28," Yes, because I might trust you, and I don't know if I do yet, but I don't trust the other  people who work here because I don't know if they're working for the government, which  they probably are working for the government."
SPEAKER_01,336.903,343.918," So they can actually have access to all of my notes and the things that you're writing  down, which I don't know what they are because you're not going to get me a copy of it yet."
SPEAKER_01,344.842,356.634," And I just don't trust that they can actually get that information in because they're going  to use it to their advantage, and they're going to give it to the government, which  I can't have that happening."
SPEAKER_01,357.24,358.876, So could you please not take notes?
SPEAKER_00,359.503,360.371, I can not take notes.
SPEAKER_00,361.461,365.019, What kind of information and notes are you worried that the government's going to get?
SPEAKER_01,365.943,384.859," Well, because I made my room at home government-proof, I think they're going to get a copy of my notes  and I'm going to try to steal that technology that I actually created so that they can then  disrupt my room and then everybody else's rooms who are just like mine so that they  can then use their mind control to then control me to do the things that they want me to do."
SPEAKER_00,385.782,390.2," So without the protection that your house offers, they could control your mind?"
SPEAKER_01,390.914,391.18, Correct.
SPEAKER_01,391.742,401.634," Without my room and without the technology and the systems and the things that I created,  then the government will be able to control everything that I do."
SPEAKER_00,407.281,407.705, All right.
SPEAKER_00,409.28,413.698, So can you tell me about your mood through all this?
SPEAKER_00,414.16,415.16, So this sounds really stressful.
SPEAKER_00,415.16,421.438, You're describing an environment where the government's frequently looking at what you're doing.
SPEAKER_00,423.589,424.16, What are the feelings there?
SPEAKER_00,425.181,426.575, Do you feel sad or angry?
SPEAKER_01,427.467,428.12, I feel fine.
SPEAKER_00,428.426,428.916, You feel fine?
SPEAKER_01,429.344,429.977, I feel fine.
SPEAKER_01,431.406,434.08," I don't really have – yeah, I just feel fine."
SPEAKER_01,434.847,436.1," I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad."
SPEAKER_01,436.281,438.254, I just – I'm just here.
SPEAKER_00,440.405,444.06, Kind of resigned that the government's going to do this?
SPEAKER_01,444.281,451.019," Well, the government's going to do what they're going to do anyway, so it doesn't matter if  I'm happy, sad, pissed off, angry, any of that."
SPEAKER_01,452.1,457.696," The government's going to make me do what they want me to do anyway, so it doesn't matter how I feel."
SPEAKER_00,461.08,464.935, Are you worried that something is going to happen that's similar to what happened on the bus?
SPEAKER_01,467.08,483.654," No, because I've learned my lesson to not say those things out loud and to talk about  what the government's doing because I can't actually inform anybody else because nobody's  listening to me because they're already controlled by the government because they don't have a room like I do at home."
SPEAKER_00,486.321,489.075, So you avoid that in the future because it didn't really work?
SPEAKER_01,490.591,490.795, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,491.422,495.518, You weren't able to help them understand what's going on?
SPEAKER_01,497.04,501.0," Well, if people don't understand what's going on, then that's their fault and that's their problem."
SPEAKER_01,501.222,502.171, They should have listened to me.
SPEAKER_01,503.442,510.253, I could have actually gave them the technology that they needed to actually create the room  so that the government can't hear them.
SPEAKER_00,511.081,512.313, But they weren't open to that idea?
SPEAKER_01,513.0,513.041, No.
SPEAKER_00,514.586,515.374, Quite the opposite.
SPEAKER_01,516.02,516.909, Completely the opposite.
SPEAKER_00,519.241,521.452, How are your family relationships?
SPEAKER_00,524.041,524.449, How's that going?
SPEAKER_01,525.0,525.531, They're okay.
SPEAKER_01,526.465,527.212, I live with my mom.
SPEAKER_01,528.545,529.737, She does what she's supposed to.
SPEAKER_01,530.08,535.639," She doesn't go in my room because she knows that if she goes into the room, it's going to mess up the technology so she stays out."
SPEAKER_00,537.566,538.536, So you get along with her okay?
SPEAKER_01,539.869,540.374, We're fine.
SPEAKER_00,542.269,543.437, Anybody else you have contact with?
SPEAKER_00,545.354,545.96," Friends, family?"
SPEAKER_01,546.823,550.86," No, just I talk to people all the time but they're just in my head."
SPEAKER_01,551.582,559.417, We have conversations all the time about how we can actually make the world a better place  and then how we can actually go through and then destroy the government.
SPEAKER_01,560.824,563.457," But yeah, I just talk to them in my head."
SPEAKER_00,566.96,571.378," Alright Jason, I'm sorry to hear that you're under stress."
SPEAKER_00,573.324,578.699, I'm glad to hear you feel like your mood's okay if you're not down or anxious or anything.
SPEAKER_00,580.96,589.9," This, answering these questions for me, this has been helpful  and I'm going to recommend you continue to see a counselor here if that's okay."
SPEAKER_00,590.081,591.455, I realize you're court ordered.
SPEAKER_01,591.96,593.334, Can this counselor be you?
SPEAKER_00,594.889,595.314, It could be me.
SPEAKER_00,596.96,598.839, Would that make you feel more comfortable?
SPEAKER_01,598.94,600.9, That would make me feel much better.
SPEAKER_00,600.92,607.419," Well then I'll put on the schedule, we'll set a time up front where I'll see you, let's say in three days."
SPEAKER_00,608.486,608.869, That works?
SPEAKER_01,609.92,610.526, Three days works.
SPEAKER_00,612.183,613.839, And we'll go from there.
SPEAKER_00,613.94,614.405, Thanks Jason.
