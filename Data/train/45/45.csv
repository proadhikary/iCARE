SPEAKER_00,15.118,16.06, Hi Sherry. how you're doing today?
SPEAKER_01,16.682,18.299, I'm doing okay.
SPEAKER_00,18.44,18.867, You're doing okay?
SPEAKER_00,19.7,22.575, I understand you have been feeling too great lately.
SPEAKER_01,23.962,25.266," I mean, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,29.441,34.539, I'm never like feeling awesome really.
SPEAKER_01,35.301,39.633, But lately it's come to my awareness.
SPEAKER_01,43.082,46.856, But something might be wrong.
SPEAKER_00,48.04,48.754, Something might be wrong?
SPEAKER_00,49.326,50.02, In what way?
SPEAKER_01,50.04,50.285, Maybe.
SPEAKER_01,52.427,54.879," Well, it's not anything new."
SPEAKER_01,56.323,59.491, But I have a lot of trouble sleeping.
SPEAKER_01,63.08,65.879," You know, I usually, I don't go to bed early."
SPEAKER_01,66.302,68.6," You know, I might go to bed a little bit late."
SPEAKER_01,68.6,70.719, But then I wake up always really early.
SPEAKER_01,70.88,75.537," Like I'll set my alarm for like eight, but I always wake up at like five or something."
SPEAKER_01,76.36,77.426, And then I can't get back to sleep.
SPEAKER_00,80.127,80.718, All right.
SPEAKER_00,80.8,82.016, So you're waking up earlier than you want to?
SPEAKER_01,82.382,82.749, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,83.28,84.91, I can't get back to sleep no matter how hard I try.
SPEAKER_01,86.5,88.056, And I'm tired still during the day.
SPEAKER_01,88.743,90.258," You know, I don't have a lot of energy."
SPEAKER_01,90.48,91.48, But it doesn't matter.
SPEAKER_01,91.561,93.577, It's just it's hard for me to go to sleep.
SPEAKER_01,93.92,96.372, And it's been like that for a really long time.
SPEAKER_01,98.0,98.755, Probably since high school.
SPEAKER_00,99.286,100.0, Right.
SPEAKER_01,101.002,108.419," But, you know, lately I just, I realize, you know, some days are better than others."
SPEAKER_01,110.223,116.909, But it's been a couple weeks ago that really like made me feel like I should have talked  to someone.
SPEAKER_00,118.268,118.672, What happened?
SPEAKER_01,120.485,123.138," Well, my brother got married."
SPEAKER_01,124.144,126.116, And I'm very close to him.
SPEAKER_01,127.585,129.438, And I was really looking forward to the wedding.
SPEAKER_01,130.521,142.893," And then when I went, I just, I mean, I didn't not enjoy it, but I just didn't have as much  fun as I thought I would."
SPEAKER_01,143.64,149.939," And I know it's just because of, you know, my mood, like that I'm always a little gloomy."
SPEAKER_01,151.082,161.26," You know, like, so my brother says I'm like, you're, you know, so like, but I was really  looking, like I, you know, I step out of my comfort zone."
SPEAKER_01,161.34,162.611, I like to try new things.
SPEAKER_01,163.68,164.92, And I was really looking forward to this one.
SPEAKER_01,164.94,172.919," I used to love, I love weddings, you know, and it's not that I don't love them now, but  I thought I would enjoy it more than I did."
SPEAKER_01,173.924,176.155, And that kind of like freaked me out.
SPEAKER_00,177.2,182.138," So your mood, your mood didn't elevate like maybe you hoped it would."
SPEAKER_01,182.72,182.863, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,185.106,192.398," I mean, I would have thought that, I mean, I've been looking forward to this wedding  for a year and a half, but you know, I've helped, you know, my now sister plan it."
SPEAKER_01,192.84,203.877," And it just wasn't as fun as I wanted it to be, or as I thought it would be, you know."
SPEAKER_00,205.76,209.218, And realizing this is what brought you in today.
SPEAKER_01,210.558,210.68, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,211.001,217.29," And like right afterwards, like last week, you know, it was, I had more worse days than  better days."
SPEAKER_01,218.34,234.659," And I would go up early the next morning, even though I had been up late at the wedding,  and just sat there and thought about it and was really just upset by the whole thing,  upset that I couldn't be more happy for, you know, my brother."
SPEAKER_01,234.96,236.677," For me, really, not even for my brother."
SPEAKER_01,237.242,238.349, Because I was happy for him.
SPEAKER_01,240.04,244.659," It just didn't, I didn't feel excited like everyone else."
SPEAKER_01,245.14,247.129," Everyone else around me was having such a good time, and I was just..."
SPEAKER_00,249.76,250.087, More down.
SPEAKER_01,250.76,255.372," Yeah, like I was happier than I would be if I was staying at home by myself, but I wasn't,  I wasn't like everyone else."
SPEAKER_00,260.548,260.793, All right.
SPEAKER_00,261.561,267.358, So you mentioned that this is going on from high school?
SPEAKER_01,268.303,268.507, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,269.16,270.109, So how long would that be?
SPEAKER_01,271.4,276.938,"So I mean, I graduated in 2010, so eight years."
SPEAKER_00,280.4,280.945, So about eight years.
SPEAKER_00,282.4,284.38," And you've been, you've been feeling down."
SPEAKER_00,284.541,287.696," Has the, the sleep been a problem for that long?"
SPEAKER_01,288.4,301.115," Yeah, I mean, I, a little bit when I was in high school, I thought it was, you know, I  thought it was just a quirk or something about staying up late and like hours in high school,  but it never like got better."
SPEAKER_01,302.583,312.419," Even when I, you know, started working out of school and stuff, I, my sleep schedule  never came to that normal eight hours a night like you're supposed to."
SPEAKER_01,312.761,314.976," I know no one's ever is, but it just never, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,315.7,321.408," So sleep's always been an issue, and I just, like I said, my brother's called me Eeyore  for years just because I..."

SPEAKER_00,353.223,353.627, In the morning?
SPEAKER_01,354.9,359.972," Especially when I'm just like sitting there with my thoughts, when I can't get back to  sleep, it will be bad."
SPEAKER_01,361.14,378.292," And then, you know, it'll be time to get ready for the day, and I'll be angry and mad that  it's, you know, that I, I can't sleep, and then depressed about, you know, that I'm like  this, that I'm weird."
SPEAKER_01,379.401,385.655," And then, I mean, as the day goes on, I forget about it a little bit, and it gets a little  bit better in the afternoons."
SPEAKER_01,386.441,390.299," And nighttime, I'm really like, you know, I enjoy spending time with my family for dinner  and stuff like that."
SPEAKER_01,390.36,398.173," So, it gets better as the day goes on, but, you know, in the morning, it's, it's bad because  I just spent hours lying there thinking about it."
SPEAKER_00,399.643,401.077," So, morning, morning's the worst."

SPEAKER_01,427.681,434.605," Like, I still, you know, I still seek out fun activities, and I still participate in  them."
SPEAKER_01,435.4,439.697," And, I mean, they'll make me feel better than not doing them."
SPEAKER_01,441.021,451.519," But it's just, I don't know, it's just, I don't, I guess, my response to them isn't  as high as I see other people enjoying activities."
SPEAKER_01,452.003,454.137," And I don't, but I do enjoy them."
