SPEAKER_00,14.558,15.459," Hi Jason, how are you doing today?"
SPEAKER_00,16.522,16.869,I'm okay.
SPEAKER_01,17.93,18.256,I'm alright.
SPEAKER_00,18.603,19.032,You're alright?
SPEAKER_01,19.44,20.113,I'm just here.
SPEAKER_00,20.501,20.971,You're just here?
SPEAKER_01,21.603,22.011,Just here.
SPEAKER_00,23.405,25.978,I understand that you were in the hospital a couple of weeks ago.
SPEAKER_01,26.98,29.076," Yeah, I was in the hospital about two weeks ago."
SPEAKER_01,30.001,35.257,I did something and I had to go to the hospital afterwards.
SPEAKER_00,36.24,36.787,You tell me about it?
SPEAKER_01,37.88,55.479," Yeah, so about two weeks ago I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating  in my room so that the government can't hear my thoughts or my actions or my behaviors  and I was just trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build."
SPEAKER_01,56.36,73.338," I went over to the neighbor because their garage was open and I just picked out a tool  and I brought it back to the house and when I was in the house working on my room, the  cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital and I was just like, see, the  government's at it again."
SPEAKER_00,74.486,75.934,What do you think the government's trying to do?
SPEAKER_01,76.96,89.859,They're trying to stop me from actually creating my room because they're creating this new  order where they want everybody to follow them and I'm not a follower.
SPEAKER_01,90.763,97.514,I know what I want and I know what I need and I know what my family wants and I know  what they need and I'm just trying to protect them by creating my room.
SPEAKER_00,98.88,99.998,And tell me about your room.
SPEAKER_00,100.401,103.637,What are you doing there that makes that special?
SPEAKER_01,104.621,132.855,So I'm smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that  the government is actually sending through the lights and also through the TV and through  every electronic apparatus that is out there and I'm actually creating a doll or a wave  neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening so that you can actually live  the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time.
SPEAKER_00,134.48,136.418,Is that how you were feeling when you were building it?
SPEAKER_01,136.62,143.64," Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room and any time I'm basically in there,  it was good."
SPEAKER_01,143.884,144.74,I had energy.
SPEAKER_01,144.9,153.819,I did everything that I wanted but my prototype was running out of fuel and so I needed to make  it bigger and larger so it can run longer.
SPEAKER_00,154.909,156.12,That's what you're trying to do when you...
SPEAKER_01,156.662,161.6," Yeah, that's what I was trying to do when I wasn't borrowed the tools from my neighbor."
SPEAKER_01,162.7,193.94," And then also I was ordering some things that were online and they were also supposed to be  shipped in so that the base piece that I was creating that I used the tools from my neighbor's  house, it could have been all perfect and set so that when all of the hard drives and the  electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could just plug it in and then not only have my  room covered but also my house is covered and then all of my family, they could just be happy."
SPEAKER_00,194.771,195.359,They could be happy?
SPEAKER_01,195.543,196.137,They could be happy.
SPEAKER_00,196.442,197.519,Like you were happy.
SPEAKER_01,197.64,198.51,Like I was happy.
SPEAKER_01,199.4,201.658," So two weeks ago, I was good."
SPEAKER_01,202.324,202.911,I was up.
SPEAKER_01,203.8,215.53,I did all the calculations that I needed to create so I could actually build my base and my system  but then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house but  then also out of the house.
SPEAKER_01,216.74,222.26,Then I also had the opportunity to just not sleep because who needs sleep?
SPEAKER_01,222.401,223.756,I wasn't tired.
SPEAKER_01,224.2,230.839," If I did sleep, I slept for like 15 minutes just because I needed to finish what I was going to do."
SPEAKER_01,231.662,238.44,I was so close to finishing and my neighbor called the cops.
SPEAKER_00,239.205,241.06,So you had a period of time.
SPEAKER_00,241.643,245.3,We had like a lot of energy and you weren't really sleeping much?
SPEAKER_01,245.729,245.934,Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,246.343,247.076,Did you need to...
SPEAKER_01,247.686,248.639,Doesn't everybody do that?
SPEAKER_00,249.625,252.28,You were also happy and felt satisfied?
SPEAKER_01,252.32,252.831,I felt good.
SPEAKER_01,254.04,258.415," Like when I sleep, I don't like when I sleep because it just feels wrong."
SPEAKER_01,259.96,262.237,I'm not actually using my time wisely.
SPEAKER_01,263.122,267.278," So those last two weeks or two weeks ago, it was perfect."
SPEAKER_01,267.881,269.359,It was the best time of my life.
SPEAKER_01,269.5,272.838,Like I was living the same living life to your fullest.
SPEAKER_01,273.2,274.857,I was living life to my fullest then.
SPEAKER_01,275.18,275.948,It was perfect.
SPEAKER_00,277.301,278.771,How do you feel now in comparison?
SPEAKER_01,280.142,280.594,I'm all right.
SPEAKER_00,280.861,281.52,You're all right?
SPEAKER_01,281.683,282.334,I'm all right.
SPEAKER_01,282.741,283.711,Just all right right now.
SPEAKER_01,284.58,289.537,The government made me go on different medication.
SPEAKER_01,290.521,292.378,So just all right.
SPEAKER_01,292.681,293.453,Not that happy.
SPEAKER_01,293.88,294.63,Not that excited.
SPEAKER_00,295.46,296.094,So not happy?
SPEAKER_00,296.36,296.968,How about sad?
SPEAKER_01,297.88,298.896," No, I'm not sad either."
SPEAKER_01,299.181,299.585,It's just...
SPEAKER_00,301.02,301.797,Kind of in the middle?
SPEAKER_01,302.0,302.524,In the middle.
SPEAKER_00,304.701,306.436,Do you want to get back to that happiness?
SPEAKER_01,306.903,307.198,Of course.
SPEAKER_01,307.26,310.519,Who doesn't want to get back to the happiness of their life?
SPEAKER_01,310.68,313.799,That's the reason why I need to finish my machine.
SPEAKER_00,313.96,314.413,The machine?
SPEAKER_01,314.64,314.762,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,316.24,320.198,Now you mentioned you'd ordered some products online.
SPEAKER_00,320.58,321.708,How much did you order?
SPEAKER_01,323.64,325.148,I think I ordered probably...
SPEAKER_01,327.381,328.719," No, the exact number."
SPEAKER_01,328.8,339.72,I ordered 236 hard drives because 236  is the perfect number that I needed to not only cover  my bedroom so I could always be happy.
SPEAKER_01,339.8,343.175," And if the system went down, my room  was always going to be covered."
SPEAKER_01,343.56,348.156," But then within that 236, it also covered my house  so that my family could be happy."
SPEAKER_01,348.581,351.854,And my four neighbors were around us  so we could all be happy.
SPEAKER_01,352.36,364.215,And that's the reason why I'm kind of angry at my one  neighbor because I was including his house in on my grid  so that he can also be happy all the time.
SPEAKER_00,365.04,366.515,He would have been affected by your machine?
SPEAKER_01,367.162,367.652,Of course.
SPEAKER_01,368.081,369.298,He's the one that needs me.
SPEAKER_01,369.44,370.156,He helped me out.
SPEAKER_01,370.32,371.458,He let me borrow his tools.
SPEAKER_01,371.6,374.259," But evidently, he didn't let me borrow them this time."
SPEAKER_01,374.36,376.153,So I'm going to just pull him out.
SPEAKER_01,377.06,378.911,I'll have another neighbor take his place.
SPEAKER_00,380.32,382.812,Were all those hard drives fairly expensive?
SPEAKER_01,384.541,386.317,I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,386.68,392.999," When I was up cleaning and running around the house trying  to find more equipment, I found my mom's purse."
SPEAKER_01,393.08,395.538," And I was just like, oh my god, she  has a credit card in there."
SPEAKER_01,395.68,397.195," Oh my god, I can use her credit card."
SPEAKER_01,397.64,401.372,So I was using her credit card because I  was trying to make her happy.
SPEAKER_01,402.201,403.679,And so I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,403.8,404.586,I was at 236.
SPEAKER_01,406.44,413.198," They were probably $50 to $100 apiece,  depending on where I could get them."
SPEAKER_01,413.38,415.29,And I just ordered them.
SPEAKER_00,417.22,418.67,How did your mother respond to that?
SPEAKER_01,420.12,421.859," Well, my mom came to the hospital."
SPEAKER_01,421.96,424.759," I was just like, where are all these boxes coming from?"
SPEAKER_01,424.88,426.292," I'm just like, just put them in my room with them."
SPEAKER_01,427.32,428.679,And she put them in my room.
SPEAKER_01,428.76,432.874," And then a week ago, she was just like,  I see you use my credit card."
SPEAKER_01,433.48,435.496,She wasn't too happy with me.
SPEAKER_00,436.12,437.35,Is that a strange relationship?
SPEAKER_01,438.6,441.373," No, that's just how my mom's relationship generally is."
SPEAKER_00,442.84,443.712,You get along OK with it?
SPEAKER_01,444.34,445.657,We get along perfectly fine.
SPEAKER_01,445.94,447.795,That's how we talk to each other.
SPEAKER_01,448.36,452.857," We talk to each other literally because she's not in my room,  so she's not happy."
SPEAKER_01,453.14,456.9," So any time she does come into my room,  Beth is on the balance."
SPEAKER_01,456.92,458.038,So I get unhappy.
SPEAKER_01,458.18,463.308,And then I just tell her to stay out so that I can be happy  and she can be happy in her own place.
SPEAKER_00,465.72,469.094,And you mentioned that they changed your medications  in the hospital.
SPEAKER_01,469.681,471.099,The government changed my medications.
SPEAKER_00,471.16,471.611,The government?
SPEAKER_01,471.96,472.224,Yes.
SPEAKER_00,473.28,475.693,How are you feeling about taking your medications?
SPEAKER_01,477.14,487.875," Well, so the only reason I'm taking my medications now  is because if I don't take them, then they're  going to change them again."
SPEAKER_01,488.3,494.017," And then it's going to delay me in finishing my generator,  my wave generator."
SPEAKER_01,494.281,496.175,And I need to finish my wave generator.
SPEAKER_01,496.9,505.114," So I'm taking them because I don't want the government  to have more power over me, like they want  to have power over everybody else."
SPEAKER_01,506.0,507.086,So I'm trying to avoid that.
SPEAKER_00,509.586,509.899,All right.
SPEAKER_00,509.92,512.395,So you really want to get back to working on that machine?
SPEAKER_01,513.221,513.427,Yes.
SPEAKER_01,513.941,515.913,I want to be back in my happy place.
SPEAKER_00,517.08,522.037,Have you found yourself as motivated these last couple  weeks as you were before you were hospitalized?
SPEAKER_01,522.422,522.588,No.
SPEAKER_01,523.081,524.689,I haven't been that motivated.
SPEAKER_01,527.283,528.554,I know I'm going to get it done.
SPEAKER_01,529.32,533.818,It's just I just don't know if I'm  going to get it done today or tomorrow.
SPEAKER_01,534.101,535.433,But I know it's going to get done.
SPEAKER_00,536.24,537.079,You still want to get that done.
SPEAKER_00,537.12,537.76,It's important to you?
SPEAKER_01,537.802,537.885,Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,538.3,539.94,It's really important to me because I
SPEAKER_01,540.061,542.031,can't be controlled by the government anymore.
SPEAKER_00,544.126,544.656," All right, Jason."
SPEAKER_00,544.92,547.915,I'd like you to continue seeing a counselor here.
SPEAKER_00,549.06,550.348,Have you found the counseling to be helpful?
SPEAKER_01,552.341,553.415,The counseling has been OK.
SPEAKER_00,553.861,554.397,It's been OK?
SPEAKER_01,554.541,554.724,Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,555.781,560.45,I appreciate that they haven't been taking notes  because I don't want that information to be leaked out.
SPEAKER_01,562.761,563.351,But it's been OK.
SPEAKER_00,563.88,564.395,It's been OK?
SPEAKER_01,564.685,564.955,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,565.264,565.592,All right.
SPEAKER_00,566.001,567.139,We'll continue with counseling.
SPEAKER_00,567.2,570.619,And I hope that can help you a bit.
SPEAKER_00,571.204,573.731,And I appreciate you spending this time with me  and explaining what happened.
SPEAKER_01,574.673,575.644,Thank you.
