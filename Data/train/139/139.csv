SPEAKER_01,110.03,112.521,I would say like a modern  amount.
SPEAKER_01,112.541,116.233,I'm not really really popular or like I have no friends.
SPEAKER_01,116.855,117.638,I'm like normal.
SPEAKER_00,119.263,120.366, That's a good way to be right?
SPEAKER_01,120.386,120.487,Yeah.

SPEAKER_00,130.872,131.735,Okay great.
SPEAKER_00,132.237,138.929,Well one thing I  want to ask about is you know different people have sort of different values or  things that are important to them.
SPEAKER_00,138.989,145.183,They might you know be really close with  family or really have you know their friends as being something particularly  important.
SPEAKER_00,145.524,160.803,"I'm going to show you just a few things on this sheet and if you can  look them over so there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity,  family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination, and  spirituality."
SPEAKER_00,161.545,164.392,Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?
SPEAKER_00,164.412,172.653,"Family  definitely, friendship, and belonging."
SPEAKER_00,172.974,175.901,Okay what's important to you about your  family?
SPEAKER_01,176.604,183.409,Well I love them so I want them to think well of me and I want them to  be accepting and love me.
SPEAKER_00,183.73,185.357,Okay and you have brothers or sisters?
SPEAKER_01,185.377,186.281,Yeah I have one  sister.
SPEAKER_00,186.442,189.05,Okay great and how about friendship?
SPEAKER_01,189.532,196.061,Friendship I've grown close  to many people that I care about so I would like them to be accepting of me as  well.
SPEAKER_00,196.403,201.004,Great so being a good friend and having people who are good friends too  is important.
SPEAKER_00,201.406,202.554,And then what about belonging?
SPEAKER_00,202.594,203.58,You mentioned that one too.
SPEAKER_01,204.002,208.76, Yeah just a sense of like fitting in and not and like being accepted in general.
SPEAKER_00,209.202,211.732, Yeah not wanting to be part of a group.
SPEAKER_01,211.912,212.635,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,212.876,213.659,Okay great.
SPEAKER_00,214.442,227.075, Alright well one of the things I want to talk about is you know you mentioned  that you like to go out with friends and party and that sort of a thing and I'm  curious when you're at the parties do you ever have any alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,227.417,230.291,Um not much  maybe like one or two drinks at the most.
SPEAKER_00,230.592,234.932,Okay can you tell me a little bit about  how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?
SPEAKER_01,235.615,243.915,Um I pretty much just have  a drink just just have it like so it looks like I'm drinking even though I'm  not so maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something.
SPEAKER_00,244.217,249.606,Okay you're kind  of getting pressure from other people who are drinking and it feels easier for  you to hold a drink.
SPEAKER_01,249.626,251.756,Yeah just have one there and pretend you have it.
SPEAKER_00,252.077,259.984,Okay and  do you think that this is most weekends or occasionally how often do you think  that you are around alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,260.004,262.335,Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most.
SPEAKER_00,264.062,267.959, So one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol.
SPEAKER_01,267.999,268.12,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,268.601,271.49, Okay and what sort of situations are you in?
SPEAKER_01,272.312,276.587,Well just I guess at a party or  something someone's house.
SPEAKER_00,276.787,277.008,Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_01,277.47,282.01,Or even if it's not a party like a small social  gathering maybe there'll be like a few beers around.
SPEAKER_00,282.03,285.145,So mainly just kind of  hanging out with friends?
SPEAKER_01,285.165,286.048,Pretty much yeah.
SPEAKER_00,286.852,293.072,Are you ever places where there are  parents around or mostly just just with the kids?
SPEAKER_01,293.895,301.187,Mostly just with us but  sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to  their family as well so we'll all just hang out.
SPEAKER_00,302.43,303.714,And what about driving?
SPEAKER_01,303.734,306.323,Um like  drunk driving?
SPEAKER_00,306.484,310.264,Yeah do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any  alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,310.324,314.003,Definitely not I've never drunk driven and I've never been in a car with  a drunk driver.
SPEAKER_00,314.706,318.1,So that's something that you've sort of made a decision about.
SPEAKER_01,318.2,320.151, Yeah because I know that's extremely dangerous.
SPEAKER_00,320.372,323.225,Okay what do you know about  how that's dangerous?
SPEAKER_01,323.927,335.117,Well alcohol definitely impairs your judgment so I  mean driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and  accidents and things like that so I'd rather not be in that situation.
SPEAKER_00,335.137,339.722,So you're  really trying to be safe and make sure that you're not putting yourself in that  situation.
SPEAKER_00,339.783,346.751,That's great you know it's it's tough to do sometimes and I really  commend you for being able to to stick with that.
SPEAKER_01,346.771,347.173,Thank you.
SPEAKER_00,347.997,352.279,So you mentioned you  pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two.
SPEAKER_00,352.299,355.354,What do you  think's the most alcohol you've ever had in in one day?
SPEAKER_01,355.374,356.5,No more than two drinks.
SPEAKER_00,356.72,359.289, Okay so the the absolute most.
SPEAKER_01,359.309,360.091,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,360.733,364.165,Okay and what kinds of things do you  like about alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,365.61,373.237,I've never really been drunk so I can't really say that I  like that feeling or not but it's just I mean you're just in a good mood.
SPEAKER_00,373.257,378.091,Mm-hmm  so it just kind of makes you feel relaxed?
SPEAKER_01,378.152,379.535,Yeah yeah relaxed.
SPEAKER_00,379.796,381.481,Okay anything  else?
SPEAKER_01,383.268,386.801,No not really like I said I don't drink that much so I wouldn't be able to  tell you.
SPEAKER_00,387.323,391.013,Okay and any not so good things about alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,392.698,405.816,Definitely yeah I  mean when I'm at parties it's up and it's getting a little later some people  that drink like drank too much they start throwing up or they get hurt or  they're really loud and obnoxious and that's not fun for anybody.
SPEAKER_00,405.836,411.162,So you've  seen a lot of other kids who had some consequences and decided that's not  for you.
SPEAKER_01,411.322,411.704,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,412.045,412.386,Got it.
SPEAKER_00,413.049,413.972,I can understand that.
SPEAKER_00,414.975,416.581,Any other things that you can think  of?
SPEAKER_01,417.164,424.133,No I mean I've never you know been friends with anybody that's got into  like a serious accident and stuff it's just very like obnoxious thing.
SPEAKER_00,424.294,441.496,Okay well  so you know as someone who's not 21 yet it is underage drinking is something  that's not illegal and it is something that is considered pretty risky so I  wonder what you think about that just in terms of how it fits into your life?
SPEAKER_01,442.078,446.553,Um I  know it's definitely risky but I mean I guess we still do it.
SPEAKER_00,446.573,451.248,Uh-huh so it's kind  of something that you're... It's just there.
SPEAKER_00,451.268,463.424,It's just there okay and I'm curious you  mentioned you know your friends are important to you and your family is  important to you and sort of fitting in is important to you and how does alcohol  play a role with that?
SPEAKER_01,463.444,476.562,Um well definitely not in my family life because my parents  don't really condone alcohol use but friendships I mean when I'm hanging  out with my friends or we're at a party or something there's usually alcohol  involved.
SPEAKER_00,476.863,482.306,Okay so from your family perspective the drinking is not  something that fits very well.
SPEAKER_01,482.908,483.089,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,483.551,492.986,And with friends you feel like it's easier  to hang out with alcohol or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your  friends wouldn't like you as much.
SPEAKER_01,493.146,494.712,I guess I mean this is just there.
SPEAKER_00,494.732,495.535,Okay.
SPEAKER_01,497.462,498.988, Ties in with the whole belonging thing.
SPEAKER_00,499.008,508.504,Okay well when you think about your drinking and  sort of looking forward in five years or ten years how do you think the drinking  might fit in with your life?
SPEAKER_01,509.748,516.191,It probably will have a very small role if any in my  life considering I have big plans for my future.
SPEAKER_00,516.331,519.547,Okay can you expand on that a  little bit more what do you mean?
SPEAKER_01,519.868,527.97,I mean I don't think I would be you know  drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school or in  college or trying to get it off school things like that.
SPEAKER_00,528.392,533.911,Okay so the alcohol  something that might make it harder to reach your goals.
SPEAKER_01,534.091,535.114,Yeah definitely.
SPEAKER_00,536.659,541.944,So when  you're sort of looking ahead how often do you think you might be drinking say  when you get to college?
SPEAKER_01,544.111,550.415,Maybe less than I am now I mean I don't drink much  anyway so maybe like one drink every once in a blue moon.
SPEAKER_00,550.716,554.891,Okay so you sort of  have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually.
SPEAKER_00,555.192,555.794,How might that go?
SPEAKER_01,555.815,568.758,Well I  mean I guess right now I would try to stop in high school and once I get older  maybe just like socially once in a while but not anything big or anything.
SPEAKER_00,568.918,574.586,Yeah so you  don't feel the need to make any major changes but you feel like you could make  some adjustments that would make it easier.
SPEAKER_01,574.606,575.55,Definitely yeah that's a good word.
SPEAKER_00,575.57,586.124,Okay how important is it to you to make  some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of one to ten where one is not at  all important not something you're thinking about and ten is the most  important thing?
SPEAKER_01,586.425,587.55,Maybe a five or six.
SPEAKER_00,588.072,590.723,And why'd you say five or six rather than  like two or three?
SPEAKER_01,591.085,598.404,Because it's not something I do not care about at all but  it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to  change about myself.
SPEAKER_00,598.705,601.639,Okay so it is something you have thought about.
SPEAKER_01,601.679,601.8,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,603.747,608.804, And how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted  to on that same scale?
SPEAKER_01,608.824,616.37,I'm pretty confident that I can considering that  I'm not really an alcohol user per se.
SPEAKER_01,617.073,621.186,I'm not really into that whole scene so  it's not gonna be difficult for me.
SPEAKER_00,621.507,622.972,So what number do you think you'd say?
SPEAKER_01,622.992,627.308,On a  scale of one to ten if I can quit or not?
SPEAKER_00,627.529,627.791,Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,628.132,629.137,Maybe like an eight or nine.
SPEAKER_00,629.157,633.234,Okay  and why'd you say eight or nine rather than even like five or six?
SPEAKER_01,633.897,637.49,Because like  I said it's not a big part of my life so it's not really that difficult.
SPEAKER_00,637.51,660.669,Okay all  right well kind of keeping that in mind it sounds like you do have sort of a  vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point and it's  moderately important to you it's something you would like to do because  you have these big goals for yourself and you actually feel very confident  that you could be successful with it.
SPEAKER_00,661.272,664.325,What sort of goal do you think might be  good to set for today?
SPEAKER_01,666.171,669.543,Probably to stop maybe next party I go to not have a  drink at all.
SPEAKER_00,669.563,674.163,Okay do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop  completely?
SPEAKER_01,674.505,684.754,Yeah I mean I can just tell my friends my friends aren't really that  pressuring it's just like outside people that I don't really know that well so I  could just tell them hey I don't feel like having a drink today.
SPEAKER_00,685.458,688.088,What might be  some benefits of following through with that goal?
SPEAKER_01,690.175,694.613,Definitely I'll have like all  my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on.
SPEAKER_00,694.633,697.444,Uh-huh  Anything else?
SPEAKER_01,698.467,703.484,Um health concerns I guess I know alcohol is bad for your health so  that would be one.
SPEAKER_00,704.026,713.545,Okay so it's it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable  with setting a goal of not drinking anymore at least at the next party and  seeing how it goes?
SPEAKER_01,713.746,713.906,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,714.268,721.079,Okay do you think it would be alright if we met  again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if it's working out for you?
SPEAKER_01,721.099,721.923,Yeah  that would be okay.
SPEAKER_00,722.285,738.528,Alright great and then it sounds like some of the benefits  you're expecting are health benefits and having an easier time with achieving  your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of  the consequences that your peers deal with.
SPEAKER_01,738.909,739.07,Right.
SPEAKER_00,739.09,740.415,Okay well very good.
SPEAKER_00,740.435,744.394,Is there  anything else that you think would be important for me to know?
SPEAKER_01,744.414,748.977,Um how would  you advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?
SPEAKER_00,749.078,773.867,Oh that's a  great question so a lot of times kids who are trying to cut back it's harder  if their friends are still drinking and one of the easiest things is trying to  have more activities that don't involve alcohol but of course that's harder if  you're not the one planning so some of the things that can be useful if you're  at a party say and there's already alcohol there and there are other kids  that maybe aren't your closest friends.
SPEAKER_00,775.093,793.31,Some of the things that I would  recommend since you're interested are you know carrying around a different  drink that looks like it has alcohol in it so you know even carrying an empty  beer bottle or beer can or you know if people are having a mixed drink just  having the Coke say without any alcohol mixed into it.
SPEAKER_00,794.915,808.17,Often having anything in  your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol  because you already have something in your hand and it kind of prevents them from  trying to stuff something else in there.
SPEAKER_00,808.412,810.583,Do you think any of those things might  work for you?
SPEAKER_01,810.624,811.487,Yeah for sure.
SPEAKER_00,811.507,823.287,Okay what about in terms of talking to your  friends about it have you thought about how you might approach with them or is  that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan  to stop drinking?
SPEAKER_01,823.548,827.346,I was just planning on playing them that I never really want to  drink anymore that wasn't me.
SPEAKER_00,827.768,830.501,Uh-huh your friends would be pretty comfortable with  that.
SPEAKER_01,830.521,832.389,Yeah I mean my closest friends for sure.
SPEAKER_00,832.75,836.926,Okay great any other concerns or  questions anything else I can help with?
SPEAKER_01,837.066,837.969,No I think I'm okay.
SPEAKER_00,838.29,850.95,Okay so then like I said I'll try and  see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going and then if  things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks  then we can maybe problem-solve together.
SPEAKER_01,851.091,851.593,Okay great.
SPEAKER_00,851.613,852.277,That sound okay?
SPEAKER_01,852.378,852.458,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,852.478,853.704,All  right thanks so much.
SPEAKER_01,853.744,854.005,No problem.
