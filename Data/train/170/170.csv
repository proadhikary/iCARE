SPEAKER_00,15.518,16.399," Hi Jo, how are you doing today?"
SPEAKER_01,17.181,17.671, I'm alright.
SPEAKER_00,18.691,19.12, Just alright?
SPEAKER_01,19.804,22.218," I mean, obviously I'm not doing great."
SPEAKER_01,22.681,25.396, I asked you to have this session.
SPEAKER_01,26.08,27.06, We weren't scheduled for today.
SPEAKER_01,27.28,44.58," I just, I don't know, I just, I'm feeling, you know, depressed as usual, but it's just,  it's stronger and I'm just feeling, I just don't want to wake up."
SPEAKER_01,44.761,45.488," I just, you know."
SPEAKER_00,47.827,48.773, You had a rough time with things?
SPEAKER_01,50.492,50.676, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,50.92,56.7, Do you know what's causing it?
SPEAKER_01,56.72,63.369," Not really, I mean, it's just the same, except worse, you know, like I just, I feel like  what's the point."
SPEAKER_01,64.94,68.978, I don't feel like continuing on.
SPEAKER_00,69.4,71.611, You don't feel like continuing with your life?
SPEAKER_01,73.56,74.224," Yeah, kind of."
SPEAKER_00,77.2,79.751, Have you been having thoughts of suicide?
SPEAKER_01,81.82,85.737," I mean, I think about what it would be like to just end things."
SPEAKER_01,86.56,97.019," I think it would be a lot easier, but at the same time, like, I can't imagine doing  it, but, you know, I can't say I haven't thought about it."
SPEAKER_00,97.561,98.911, You have had some thoughts about it.
SPEAKER_00,100.08,101.185, What prevents you from doing it?
SPEAKER_01,104.66,109.093," I don't know, I mean, I guess I know what it would be like for my family."
SPEAKER_01,111.461,112.53, I don't want to hurt them.
SPEAKER_00,115.508,116.114, And they would be hurt?
SPEAKER_01,116.72,124.485," Yes, and it's scary, I mean, the thought of dying is scary, but the thought of going on  is painful."
SPEAKER_00,127.44,131.118," So it almost sounds as if, you know, life's wearing you down a bit."
SPEAKER_01,131.701,136.089," Yeah, I kind of feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, like I just don't  know where to go from here."
SPEAKER_00,137.808,138.237, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,138.782,141.656, Have you worked out any specific plan to hurt yourself?
SPEAKER_01,143.161,168.613," No, I mean, you know, I've thought, like, if I were to do it, you know, ways, but not  specific because I just don't think that I could do it, you know, like I don't, I've  thought about suicide, but I don't, like, seriously consider it as an option, but it's  starting to, like, creep into my thoughts."
SPEAKER_01,169.92,172.879," And it never has before, so I'm, like, kind of concerned about that."
SPEAKER_01,173.08,182.755," Like, I guess I know sometimes people, like, really plan it, but for me, I've never really  considered it before, so it's really scary for me."
SPEAKER_00,183.52,187.312," Alright, so, in this, how long has this been on, these feelings?"
SPEAKER_01,190.16,206.791," I think, like, in the past couple of days, it started, you know, more so, and then, like,  the day, it was just, like, the first thought in my head, and I couldn't stop thinking about  it, and that's why I wanted to see you, because I'm just feeling, I'm starting to feel, like,  a little bit out of control."
SPEAKER_00,207.68,225.798," Okay, so, in today, and maybe the past few days, been kind of a new feeling that, a new  thought, you don't want to continue life, you want to continue living, but at the same  time, you don't want to commit suicide, you don't have a plan."
SPEAKER_01,226.38,245.417," Yeah, I don't want to, I really don't want to, but, you know, like I said, I feel like  I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, like, it's not, I know it's not a good option,  I just, like, sometimes I feel like I'm so stuck, I just don't know where else to go."
SPEAKER_00,246.72,256.517," So if, we'll call it a feeling depression, right, because that's what we've talked about  before, if the depression would go away, do you think that would change your outlook on?"
SPEAKER_01,258.463,281.457," Definitely, I think that is, like, the reason why I, the reason why the thought of not living  anymore comes into my head is because of my depression, because I just feel so, like,  my emotions are out of control because I wake up feeling so down and so useless and pointless  that it makes me wish that I was dead."
SPEAKER_01,281.76,301.879," But if I didn't have that feeling, then I wouldn't wish that I was dead, because I know  that my life has value and I know that my family would want me around and I know there's  a future for me, but my feelings make me feel like my future is just dark and pointless."
SPEAKER_00,303.901,319.37," Alright, these suicidal ideations, I know you're telling me you haven't had them before,  so I can appreciate that they're scary, they'd be scary even if you hadn't had them before,  are fairly common with depression."
SPEAKER_00,321.12,328.145," And you've, it sounds like what you're really saying is you're frustrated and you're tired  of being sick."
SPEAKER_00,330.801,342.556," And I think that you make a valid point when you say your family would be upset if anything  happened to you, because we talked about your family before and it would seem to be very  upset, right, so your life has value."
SPEAKER_00,343.12,344.591, I want you to try to hang on to that thought.
SPEAKER_00,345.88,348.732," After we're done here today, tell me what you have planned for us today."
SPEAKER_01,350.9,369.657," Well, I didn't really have plans because I kind of, you know, came here feeling like  I really needed to see you, so I kind of put things on hold, but I mean, I guess I  would go home and, you know, I'm not really sure."
SPEAKER_00,371.12,371.989, Is anybody else at home?
SPEAKER_01,374.283,385.766," No, but I mean, I probably could go to my parents' house if I needed to, I could probably  call them and see if, you know, it's getting close to the afternoon so they can get off  work soon."
SPEAKER_00,387.24,387.872, Can you do that for me?
SPEAKER_00,388.28,388.729, Can you go there?
SPEAKER_01,389.32,390.629," Yeah, I think that's a good idea."
SPEAKER_00,392.16,395.054, And we'll kind of play it by ear from that point.
SPEAKER_00,396.621,409.187," I'm going to see you today, we'll do some work today, well I'll see you again tomorrow,  alright, so if you could spend a night there, I think that would be a wiser choice given  your thoughts and your feelings right now."
SPEAKER_00,411.74,413.73, Have you ever had me use the term contract for safety?
SPEAKER_01,415.84,417.778," I think you mentioned it before, I'm not really sure."
SPEAKER_00,418.16,438.728," Okay, so what it means is you kind of, and only if it's authentic, I want this to be  true, it's kind of where you promised to me that you're going to be safe until I see you  again, right, for the foreseeable future, that you don't have any intent or plan to  harm yourself."
SPEAKER_00,439.72,440.771, Can you make that promise to me now?
SPEAKER_01,441.72,441.863, I can.
SPEAKER_00,443.081,449.995," Alright, so give me a minute and I'll come back and we'll work a little bit today and  then I'm going to schedule you to see you tomorrow as well, okay?"
SPEAKER_01,451.149,451.475, Thank you.
SPEAKER_00,451.72,452.24," Alright, thanks Jill."
