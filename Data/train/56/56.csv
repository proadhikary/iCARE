SPEAKER_00,0.0,0.163," Hi, Shari."
SPEAKER_00,1.0,1.388, How you doing today?
SPEAKER_01,2.0,2.102, Great.
SPEAKER_01,3.0,3.224, How are you?
SPEAKER_00,4.0,4.286, I'm doing well.
SPEAKER_00,5.0,5.347, Thanks for asking.
SPEAKER_01,6.0,6.286, That's awesome.
SPEAKER_00,7.0,7.429, So you're doing great?
SPEAKER_01,8.0,8.367, I am doing awesome.
SPEAKER_00,14.151,17.599, I know your brother brought you in today and he had expressed some concerns about your
SPEAKER_00,18.163,18.347, mood.
SPEAKER_00,19.0,19.959, Do you know what that's about?
SPEAKER_01,30.562,41.039," I think he's worrying for no reason because I, you know, I, for the last like week and  a half, I have been following my passion, which is baking."
SPEAKER_01,41.2,48.84, And I didn't realize this before because I worked in an office and I just realized that  that's not what I want to do with my life.
SPEAKER_01,49.223,51.579, And I know what I want to do with my life now and I've never known before.
SPEAKER_01,51.942,53.694, So this is an amazing feeling.
SPEAKER_01,54.52,57.596, And what I want to do is I want to start my own baking business.
SPEAKER_01,59.04,70.295," So what happened was that a couple, like two weeks ago, my nephew had a bake sale and I've  always, you know, I've always been like like baking, but I've always been like from the  box or like from, you know, whatever."
SPEAKER_01,70.88,79.499, So I tried for the first time making brownies from scratch and they were amazing and everyone  loved them at the bake sale and they sold out and my nephew thought I was a hero.
SPEAKER_01,79.984,80.591, Basically I was.
SPEAKER_01,81.36,89.2, And so now it made me realize like I could do this for a living and it would make me  feel amazing and make me feel like a hero for all these people.
SPEAKER_01,89.622,98.176," And I live by a college campus, so it'd be kind of cool if I could like put up something  about like delivering the bakery, like to dorms or like baked goods to dorms because  you know college students love that type of thing."
SPEAKER_01,98.801,118.236," But so anyway, so I was thinking about, long story short, having this business and I would  bake all these cookies and I'm just going to put up flyers because I don't, I'm not  like at the point where I can get like an office space, but I don't need an office space  because I have my apartment and I have everything I need in my apartment to bake everything  I need."
SPEAKER_01,118.44,125.518," And I can also, I'm a BJ's membership, so I can go to BJ's and I can get everything  I need in bulk, so like all the flour and butter and sugar and all that stuff."
SPEAKER_01,125.96,128.458, So it's not an issue if I just do it from my apartment.
SPEAKER_01,128.72,137.998, And so I was putting up flyers and trying to promote my business and that's what I've  been working on for the last week and a half and I feel great and it's amazing.
SPEAKER_01,138.54,139.5, And that's basically it.
SPEAKER_00,140.361,148.139," Alright, so you feel like everything's kind of going your way and you're really excited  about the new business idea."
SPEAKER_00,149.304,159.239, I know your brother was a little concerned with how much you've been spending on the  business idea and he mentioned some things about different relationships you've had that  are new.
SPEAKER_01,159.482,160.514," Okay, so there's a couple things with that."
SPEAKER_01,161.04,166.56," So with the spending, like I don't think my brother recognizes that when you start a business  like you need to invest in it to begin."
SPEAKER_01,167.001,187.479," And I understand why he's worried because like, so at work, well at the office job that  I had, I got in trouble because obviously you need to make flyers and I was like, oh  he doesn't realize I'm frugal, I'm smart, so I was like I'll make the flyers at work  and put them out at the work computer so that I'm not having to pay like wherever, like  staples or something to go ahead and put them out for me."
SPEAKER_01,187.6,191.418, So I got in trouble because it was like for personal use and I was using the work whatever.
SPEAKER_01,192.503,200.619," But like that's what annoys me about my brother because like the new guy that I met, which  is the other thing with the relationships, like this new guy is so supportive of my ideas."
SPEAKER_01,201.04,216.178," I met him actually in a bakery, which is like destiny, and he was so supportive when I told  him about what I was planning and actually the other guy that I was talking to before,  and I've been talking to him for a while, he was kind of like my brother and was like,  are you sure this is something you want to do?"
SPEAKER_01,216.32,220.073, And like I don't understand why you would say that to someone who's obviously sure of  what they want to do.
SPEAKER_01,220.44,225.238," Like I know I can do it, I know that I'll be successful, like did they not taste the  brownies at the bake sale?"
SPEAKER_01,225.48,226.174, Like they were amazing.
SPEAKER_01,226.762,232.238," And so that's kind of where I am and that's why my brother's worried, but he shouldn't  be because like I had all this planned out."
SPEAKER_00,234.02,240.099," Alright, he's worried that you don't, one of the things was the new relationship that  you don't know the guy too well."
SPEAKER_01,240.622,246.237," Well, I mean, I've hooked up with him a few times, like I know him pretty well and I don't  think he understands like the connection that we have."
SPEAKER_01,246.762,247.996, Like it's a pretty strong one.
SPEAKER_00,249.901,253.699," Alright, so your brother just doesn't, in your mind, he just doesn't get it."
SPEAKER_01,253.961,256.497," No, and like he doesn't like pay attention to me when I talk."
SPEAKER_01,257.04,266.299," Like I'll be trying to tell him about like the bake sale and, well not the bake sale,  well a little bit about the bake sale, like I tried to tell him about how successful it  was and he just thought that I was like bragging, but I wasn't."
SPEAKER_01,266.4,268.618, Like it was genuinely like a success.
SPEAKER_01,268.84,275.359, And then I tried to tell him about my business idea and like he's like trying to like brush  it off like it's not a good idea and that's why.
SPEAKER_01,275.48,277.878," So he just doesn't listen to me, so sometimes I try not to talk to him about it."
SPEAKER_00,280.827,284.817," Alright, have you noticed through all this any change in sleep patterns?"
SPEAKER_01,286.0,298.378," I haven't been sleeping as much, but I think that's just because I'm so excited about this  and like so I've been like staying up late and waking up early and like looking at recipes  and honestly it hasn't really been an issue because I haven't been tired at all."
SPEAKER_01,298.88,302.156," I've really, yeah I haven't, I've felt rested."
SPEAKER_01,303.041,303.531, I get enough.
SPEAKER_00,305.611,306.819," Alright, so you do feel rested."
SPEAKER_00,307.72,308.815, But you haven't been sleeping as much.
SPEAKER_01,309.2,309.261, No.
SPEAKER_00,311.244,315.76," And you clearly seem like you're in a good mood, no sadness or anything like that."
SPEAKER_01,315.981,318.293," No, like you're not going to have sadness when you're following your passion."
SPEAKER_00,320.203,322.012," Alright, so you're doing pretty well that way."
SPEAKER_00,323.6,326.918, Have you ever been down or depressed?
SPEAKER_01,327.321,329.499," Yeah, in the past I have been."
SPEAKER_01,329.64,336.016," Actually not too long ago, about four months ago, I was hospitalized because I was so down."
SPEAKER_01,337.44,344.619," But you know, and I don't feel like that now and I know what it feels like to be down and  I don't have any of that stuff."
SPEAKER_01,344.68,351.486, Like I feel so much more hopeful and happy and just great with where my life is going  right now.
SPEAKER_00,352.904,354.996," Alright, do you ever feel this way before?"
SPEAKER_00,355.76,357.0, Kind of in a really good mood?
SPEAKER_01,357.041,357.163, No.
SPEAKER_00,358.286,358.959, Nothing like this?
SPEAKER_01,359.809,359.993, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,362.128,363.334, So what do you think brought all this on?
SPEAKER_01,364.64,372.595," Honestly I just think it's like getting to know myself and getting to know like what  I want to do which is this, you know, culinary arts."
SPEAKER_00,374.08,376.298, It's kind of realizing that's kind of changed your life?
SPEAKER_01,376.52,376.663, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01,377.721,379.553," For the better, like really for the better."
SPEAKER_00,381.985,384.875," Alright, and you mentioned before that you got in some trouble at work, right?"
SPEAKER_01,386.83,387.034, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,388.004,389.014, How bad did that turn out?
SPEAKER_01,389.64,390.048, Pretty bad.
SPEAKER_01,391.162,409.669, Like it was like a final written notice so if any little thing at this point could make  me lose my job but I'm not too worried about it because at this point I'm putting so much  time into the baking business that if something goes wrong with my like office job like I'll  have this.
SPEAKER_01,410.2,424.756," Like in, I'm sure that in as short as a month like I'll be making money soon and a lot of  money because I know how much time I'm going to be putting into this, how passionate I  am about it and I know that like I'll be able to make the money back that I've put into  it so I'm not worried about it."
SPEAKER_00,425.12,426.63," Alright, but you're not too worried about that."
SPEAKER_01,428.856,429.04, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,429.121,430.618, Any medical conditions you know of?
SPEAKER_01,430.901,431.33, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,431.84,432.82, How about drug and alcohol you say?
SPEAKER_01,432.881,433.758," No, I don't use anything like that."
SPEAKER_00,433.86,434.024, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,434.84,435.636, Are you seeing or hearing anything that other people can't see or hear?
SPEAKER_01,440.931,441.033, No.
SPEAKER_00,441.36,442.229," No, nothing like that?"
SPEAKER_00,443.789,444.238, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,444.76,460.758," Sherry, so I know that you're feeling pretty well but I would like you to see a counselor  maybe help you as you contemplate these different things we've been talking about if you'd be  okay with talking to a counselor."
SPEAKER_01,461.061,461.735, I guess I'd be fine.
SPEAKER_00,462.163,462.816, You'd be okay with that?
SPEAKER_01,463.592,463.796, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,464.041,464.857, I'll get that set up.
SPEAKER_00,465.0,467.919, It'll just take a moment and I want to thank you for answering my questions.
SPEAKER_00,468.0,468.714, This has been helpful.
SPEAKER_01,469.248,469.579, You're welcome.
