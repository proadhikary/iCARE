SPEAKER_00," Will you plug the objects back in or will you, how will you do it for the items that  are already unplugged?",123.26,129.329

SPEAKER_00, Okay.,162.302,162.526
SPEAKER_00," So when it comes back, everything's unplugged.",163.46,166.114
SPEAKER_00, So you have to plug everything back in and unplug it?,167.3,169.998
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,170.34,170.462
SPEAKER_00, And go through the whole process again?,171.34,173.257

SPEAKER_01, My anxiety is really bad.,272.502,274.532

SPEAKER_00, But then it comes back.,309.386,310.08
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,310.603,310.926
SPEAKER_00, Is there anything else that you do that helps to reduce the anxiety?,313.24,318.458
SPEAKER_01," It's just I guess when I'm in the act of doing it, it will relieve it and then I'll be okay  for a little bit of time.",319.842,327.11
SPEAKER_01," Like even coming in, you know, I have like, I have somebody had chairs and some pitchers  and I just like I had to touch them, like I had to touch the chairs, but I wanted to  touch the chairs first and then the pitchers and that's normally what I do in a room.",328.321,343.839
SPEAKER_01, Like I have to touch the chairs first and I feel okay when I'm doing it and then when  I'm finished I feel a little better but then it comes back.,344.12,352.999
