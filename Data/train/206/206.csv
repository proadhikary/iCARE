SPEAKER_00,10.615,15.478, What was your relationship with your teachers and maybe those that some of the peers that  you had at the school?
SPEAKER_00,15.621,16.328, I mean was there any?
SPEAKER_01,17.642,18.519, You know what?
SPEAKER_01,18.56,19.56, Usually I didn't get along with the teachers honestly.
SPEAKER_01,19.781,22.877, I was always a class clown so I'm usually getting kicked out.
SPEAKER_01,23.66,27.816, I was always getting detention so I didn't really get along with the teachers.
SPEAKER_01,29.04,32.089, I would try and ditch class and stuff.
SPEAKER_00,36.0,40.92, So overall today are you pursuing or do you want to further your education?
SPEAKER_01,40.94,42.912, Yeah I'm trying to get into college actually.
SPEAKER_00,44.38,47.66, So you're looking into maybe like a four year old junior college.
SPEAKER_00,47.74,49.777, Yeah a junior college for right now actually.
SPEAKER_00,50.2,55.536," What would be like, give me a little bit, during the time that you were in school did  you have a job?"
SPEAKER_00,55.72,56.434, Have you worked?
SPEAKER_01,56.72,56.985, I did.
SPEAKER_01,57.72,58.679, I was working at Paul's Place.
SPEAKER_01,58.72,60.72, It's a restaurant through the school.
SPEAKER_01,60.72,62.7, And it was like a job program.
SPEAKER_01,65.326,71.808," Packaging knives and forks and napkins, salt and pepper and would send them over to the  restaurant."
SPEAKER_00,72.4,73.693, You would send them over to the restaurant?
SPEAKER_00,74.727,74.869, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,75.4,78.078," So you would prep everything, all the utensils, get ready."
SPEAKER_00,80.386,84.518," Now when you were working, how did that make you feel when you were working?"
SPEAKER_01,85.282,85.609, I liked it.
SPEAKER_01,86.16,87.554, It got boring at times honestly.
SPEAKER_01,88.16,90.19, And because the paychecks were also really small.
SPEAKER_00,92.04,92.734, But it was a start.
SPEAKER_01,93.04,93.958, Yeah it was a start.
SPEAKER_00,95.807,98.719, And so how did it make you feel good?
SPEAKER_00,99.643,103.78, Because you worked for something and then the finished product was your paycheck.
SPEAKER_00,103.921,105.337, Yeah that's what you get.
SPEAKER_00,105.56,108.438, So if you want something in life you pretty much have to work for it.
SPEAKER_00,108.823,109.68, Work for it.
SPEAKER_00,109.884,110.149, Work hard.
SPEAKER_00,110.68,111.68, It's going to teach you how to work at a young age.
SPEAKER_00,111.68,112.68, How old were you when you started working?
SPEAKER_00,112.721,112.966, I was 15.
SPEAKER_00,116.166,121.237, You were 15 years old and then you started working and it was a program for the school.
SPEAKER_00,122.32,126.019, So you know at a young age that it's going to take hard work.
SPEAKER_00,126.2,127.719, Yeah to achieve something.
SPEAKER_00,127.82,128.555, To achieve something.
SPEAKER_00,129.412,129.555, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,129.902,130.147, Great.
SPEAKER_00,131.024,131.8, Now what about your dream job?
SPEAKER_00,132.001,139.013, What would be if tomorrow you could say I'm this person tomorrow or this is my profession  tomorrow.
SPEAKER_00,139.36,140.319, What would be your dream job?
SPEAKER_00,140.523,141.074, A pilot.
SPEAKER_00,141.401,142.074, A pilot.
SPEAKER_00,142.666,143.319, Oh a pilot wow.
SPEAKER_00,143.442,144.36, And what was your reasoning behind that?
SPEAKER_00,144.38,145.319, I love airplanes.
SPEAKER_00,145.646,146.34, I used to make model airplanes.
SPEAKER_00,146.36,147.36, That's right you mentioned that you made model planes.
SPEAKER_00,147.401,147.523, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,148.38,149.34, Tell me more about that.
SPEAKER_00,149.401,150.36, What would you do in your dream job?
SPEAKER_00,150.36,151.074, I just want to fly.
SPEAKER_00,152.074,152.197, Fly.
SPEAKER_00,152.564,153.299, I like being in the air.
SPEAKER_01,153.564,154.319, I like going fast.
SPEAKER_01,154.36,154.891, Going fast.
SPEAKER_01,156.033,156.36, Going to the air.
SPEAKER_01,156.625,157.013, Going fast.
SPEAKER_01,157.625,158.238, Going fast.
SPEAKER_01,158.38,158.707, Going fast.
SPEAKER_01,159.544,160.115, Going fast.
SPEAKER_00,160.625,161.238, Going fast.
SPEAKER_00,161.36,161.584, Going fast.
SPEAKER_00,162.38,163.054, Being in the air.
SPEAKER_00,163.544,164.136, Being above.
SPEAKER_00,164.401,164.523, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,165.38,165.891, Above things.
SPEAKER_00,166.36,167.34, Being able to see from a different view.
SPEAKER_00,167.523,168.34, And so a pilot.
SPEAKER_00,168.642,171.377, Have you looked into what it would take to become a pilot?
SPEAKER_01,172.0,174.275, You know what the only star goal with that is math.
SPEAKER_01,175.263,176.818, So I don't think it's going to work out.
SPEAKER_01,177.101,178.596, What would be your next dream job?
SPEAKER_00,179.571,179.878, A cop.
SPEAKER_00,180.0,180.878, A cop.
SPEAKER_00,181.0,181.122, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,182.163,182.898, A police officer.
SPEAKER_01,183.245,184.0, Have you looked into that?
SPEAKER_01,184.0,189.35, Yeah I'm trying to get back into this cadet program I was doing for about around three  weeks ago.
SPEAKER_01,189.84,193.538, I was doing it but it was too far so I had to kind of let it go.
SPEAKER_01,193.941,195.678, And I'm trying to look for one in my area.
SPEAKER_00,196.064,196.432, Right.
SPEAKER_00,196.88,200.839, And maybe that's something we can discuss to help you find a cadet program close by.
SPEAKER_00,200.98,207.96, And then we're able to give you some goals to set and get you in a program like that.
SPEAKER_00,208.04,212.476," But let's look at, let's back up a little bit to the marijuana."
SPEAKER_00,213.54,222.097," Because you and I know being in law enforcement, you know, marijuana and being a cop, pretty  much you would have to."
SPEAKER_00,222.567,223.016, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,223.26,223.424, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,224.24,225.24," And you would have to, what would you have to do?"
SPEAKER_00,225.24,225.934, Let it go.
SPEAKER_00,226.24,227.24, You would have to let it go.
SPEAKER_00,227.481,236.12," So what we want to do while you're here, we want to help you here develop a treatment  plan, a treatment model where you can pursue some realistic goals."
SPEAKER_00,236.181,237.412, We want to set some goals for you.
SPEAKER_00,238.644,240.12, Also what about your medical history?
SPEAKER_00,240.382,242.598, Tell me a little bit about your medical history.
SPEAKER_00,243.646,245.179, Have you ever been in the hospital?
SPEAKER_00,245.542,247.097, Has anything ever happened to you?
SPEAKER_00,247.38,248.36, You've broken a bone?
SPEAKER_01,248.36,251.757, I've had surgery on my arm because I was in a motorcycle racing.
SPEAKER_01,252.421,252.993, Right.
SPEAKER_01,253.462,253.605, I fell.
SPEAKER_01,254.784,256.158, And I had to get it all stitched up.
SPEAKER_01,256.482,256.952, Right.
SPEAKER_01,258.087,259.259, And then you cut your shelf on what?
SPEAKER_00,259.561,261.998, It was a piece of metal that was scripted.
SPEAKER_00,262.544,263.299, Scripted on.
SPEAKER_00,263.845,264.794, So you got stitches.
SPEAKER_00,265.972,266.238, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,266.644,267.558, And you're doing better.
SPEAKER_00,267.74,280.418," What about in your family is there any diseases that might in your family anyone suffer from  any illnesses, ailments?"
SPEAKER_00,281.498,281.58, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,282.241,290.547," And as far as medical attention, is there anyone that needed medical attention in the  past?"
SPEAKER_00,291.2,294.019," Maybe someone on meds, in your family, psychological, health."
SPEAKER_01,294.2,295.6, Can you explain a little bit?
SPEAKER_00,295.62,300.817," Is there anyone maybe that has gone to therapy, that has been in therapy in your family, a"
SPEAKER_01,301.62,302.6, family member?
SPEAKER_01,302.6,302.682, No.
SPEAKER_00,303.743,303.967, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,305.604,313.777," And what we want to do, what I want to do to help you with this Curtis is one, we want  to develop a treatment plan to help you with the marijuana use."
SPEAKER_00,314.56,317.2, We want to be able to look at your support system.
SPEAKER_00,317.684,319.379," You know, who's in your life right now?"
SPEAKER_00,319.54,322.872," What are your, the friends that you smoke marijuana with?"
SPEAKER_00,325.681,326.395, What type of people are they?
SPEAKER_00,327.324,329.195," Would this be, is this a good fit for you?"
SPEAKER_00,330.04,333.614, But our whole goal is to start you off with small steps.
SPEAKER_00,335.04,337.451, So today you're using marijuana how many times a day?
SPEAKER_00,339.28,342.139, So you pretty much said you're using it every day.
SPEAKER_01,342.342,342.567, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,343.24,344.199, I believe you said every day.
SPEAKER_01,344.24,345.077, But how many times a day?
SPEAKER_00,345.24,346.22," Yeah, how many times a day for a month."
SPEAKER_00,346.811,347.158," Yeah, so."
SPEAKER_00,347.523,349.038, Do you wake up and you do it?
SPEAKER_00,349.24,349.383, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,350.28,353.22," It's not like my morning routine, you go ahead and do it."
SPEAKER_01,353.521,360.353," And then usually around noon time I do it again and then towards five o'clock I do it  again, then at nighttime, five other days I'll do it again."
SPEAKER_00,361.584,361.768, Right.
SPEAKER_00,362.36,372.034," So one of, maybe one of the realistic goals is you're okay, you know, we can narrow down  maybe the relationship."
SPEAKER_00,373.1,377.818," Which of your friends right now today, how many of them smoke marijuana?"
SPEAKER_01,379.83,381.199," About six, seven."
SPEAKER_00,381.584,381.85, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,382.661,387.219, Maybe a realistic short term goal is to begin to see which friends.
SPEAKER_00,387.582,388.439, To hang out with?
SPEAKER_00,388.623,388.888, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,389.48,390.153, That's what my mom told me.
SPEAKER_00,390.561,392.177, And then also your mom makes it.
SPEAKER_00,392.682,394.157, What did she tell you?
SPEAKER_01,394.48,405.48," She told me before you fall into the wrong crowd and you fall into something, just she  pretty much said that if I keep this up it's going to get me into something I don't want  to get into."
SPEAKER_01,405.949,406.46, Right.
SPEAKER_01,406.48,407.48," You know, jail time."
SPEAKER_01,407.48,407.602, Right.
SPEAKER_01,408.52,410.359," You know, because we make you do things that you shouldn't be doing."
SPEAKER_01,411.153,411.378, Right.
SPEAKER_01,411.641,412.437, And other things legal.
SPEAKER_00,413.09,413.314, Right.
SPEAKER_00,414.422,420.258," So definitely we want to look at your whole peer relationships, who your friends are."
SPEAKER_00,420.84,422.9, We also want to look at your time right now.
SPEAKER_00,422.94,425.639, So you mentioned earlier that you were working.
SPEAKER_00,425.881,426.738, Are you working today?
SPEAKER_01,427.411,427.799," No, I'm not."
SPEAKER_00,428.201,433.968," Okay, so maybe that's another thing, a realistic goal that we need to look at and maybe help  you pursue is a job."
SPEAKER_00,435.68,444.714," Maybe because the idle time sometimes can trigger events, you know, where you begin  to want to use marijuana."
SPEAKER_00,445.32,448.14, And then we can identify some of the emotions that you're feeling.
SPEAKER_00,448.523,449.974, Let's go over that maybe briefly.
SPEAKER_00,450.84,459.918," Before you get, before you smoke marijuana, is there a feeling that you have that says,  hey, I'm a little depressed."
SPEAKER_00,460.121,460.896, Depressed.
SPEAKER_00,461.08,465.135, So we can look at the depression and see how we can treat that.
SPEAKER_00,466.56,468.896," What else, what are some of the other feelings that you see?"
SPEAKER_00,469.56,471.52," Sad, angry, you know."
SPEAKER_00,471.762,473.398, What were you angry about?
SPEAKER_00,473.58,475.459, There might be asking for this.
SPEAKER_01,475.781,479.218, I would actually like to be up in the morning with my girlfriend.
SPEAKER_01,480.348,481.499, So it's kind of a stress still.
SPEAKER_01,482.365,484.52, It still bothers me as much as I'm trying to ignore it.
SPEAKER_01,485.065,486.378, It still bothers me.
SPEAKER_00,486.846,487.295, Right.
SPEAKER_00,487.56,492.199, Are there certain days that maybe perhaps you remember?
SPEAKER_00,492.58,493.499, Is there events?
SPEAKER_01,493.56,499.5, Like Thanksgiving and Christmas and holidays and things like that.
SPEAKER_01,499.701,503.439, That's when you become angry towards how you were brought up.
SPEAKER_00,503.56,503.662, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,505.284,508.198, I mean it's not that I don't appreciate my foster parents because I do.
SPEAKER_00,508.58,508.744, Right.
SPEAKER_01,509.842,512.419, But I just really have been born with my biological family.
SPEAKER_01,512.621,512.866, Right.
SPEAKER_01,513.58,515.52, But I've been a lot better.
SPEAKER_00,515.56,518.479, So we want to maybe equip you with some coping skills.
SPEAKER_00,519.449,520.479, How to cope with those things.
SPEAKER_00,520.56,523.56, How to prepare you maybe for the holidays.
SPEAKER_00,523.881,526.572, Maybe there's a way we can begin to look at that during the holidays.
SPEAKER_00,528.701,530.439, These are the emotions I feel.
SPEAKER_00,530.7,536.48, So we identify those emotions and we'll be able to take care of that.
SPEAKER_00,536.761,543.417, We'll be able to prepare you prior to you falling back into the trap and going out and  using marijuana.
SPEAKER_00,543.56,544.499, Maybe during Christmas.
SPEAKER_00,544.802,546.257, Do you feel the same way during Christmas?
SPEAKER_00,546.58,547.152, I do.
SPEAKER_00,547.58,548.009, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,548.56,551.56," Maybe even your birthday, father's day, mother's day."
SPEAKER_00,551.741,554.434, These are all the things that we can kind of get you ready for.
SPEAKER_00,555.56,559.774, Because once again it's going to take small steps.
SPEAKER_00,561.843,562.893, Realistic goals.
SPEAKER_00,564.263,570.015," And then what we want to do after that, the realistic goals is just get you ready for  long term goals."
SPEAKER_00,572.022,575.52," But Curtis, I'm glad you came into my office."
SPEAKER_00,576.368,577.459, It was great meeting you.
SPEAKER_00,577.762,579.196, I look forward to working with you.
SPEAKER_00,580.184,582.52, Is there any other questions that you may have for me?
SPEAKER_00,582.742,583.974, Is there anything that I can do at all?
SPEAKER_01,585.009,585.274, I do.
SPEAKER_01,585.56,588.057, I just kind of run a whole lot of times a week and I'm going to be allowed to come in
SPEAKER_00,589.05,589.54, to therapy.
SPEAKER_00,589.58,596.5," Well what we can do, we'll set you up with a treatment plan and then I'd like to at  least have two contacts with you a week."
SPEAKER_00,597.085,598.378, And we can go over that.
SPEAKER_00,598.881,602.654, And then maybe during one of the contacts we can help you with a job.
SPEAKER_00,604.62,607.56, And then identifying some of the emotions.
SPEAKER_00,607.781,613.078," And then maybe we can get the whole marijuana use, we can begin to kind of taper it down."
SPEAKER_00,614.342,620.54," Instead of every day, we'll begin to see how we can taper that down."
SPEAKER_00,620.701,622.03," But again, I'm glad that you came."
SPEAKER_00,623.901,629.5, It was a pleasure meeting you and we'll be in touch and we'll be able to do this again.
SPEAKER_00,629.701,631.318," Alright Curtis, good seeing you."
