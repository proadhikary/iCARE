SPEAKER_00,0.241,3.276," So Bethany, can you tell me what this week has looked like for you?"
SPEAKER_01,4.622,5.223,This week?
SPEAKER_01,5.965,11.158,"Um, I don't know, I guess it was a little bit more productive than usual, but not really."
SPEAKER_01,12.181,13.908,I'm still just usual.
SPEAKER_01,13.928,15.855,I'm dead to the world.
SPEAKER_00,17.846,18.933,Dead to the world?
SPEAKER_01,20.241,22.828," Yeah, you know, I'm just in my room most of the day."
SPEAKER_01,22.848,26.378,I'm not really part of the world or part of my family.
SPEAKER_01,27.0,32.375," I'm just closed off in my own little sad universe, I guess."
SPEAKER_00,34.743,37.795,So you're feeling isolated from your family?
SPEAKER_01,39.442,39.643,Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,39.663,43.458,"Yeah, I'm just feeling really disconnected."
SPEAKER_01,44.302,44.785,Just really...
SPEAKER_01,47.381,51.371," I don't know, it's just been a really tough week with my husband."
SPEAKER_01,51.391,53.877,"We've been fighting a lot, as usual."
SPEAKER_00,55.762,62.938," So when you say you're feeling disconnected, can you explain to me more what that looks like?"
SPEAKER_01,64.201,69.137," Yeah, I guess I'm just so tired all day."
SPEAKER_01,69.177,70.0,I'm just exhausted.
SPEAKER_01,70.883,76.659," He has all these demands and all these things he wants me to do, and I just feel like I'm not capable of doing that."
SPEAKER_01,77.02,78.386,I can't even get myself out of bed.
SPEAKER_01,78.406,81.598,I'm wondering how am I supposed to do all the things he wants me to do.
SPEAKER_01,82.942,92.78," Just last night, he came home at me like usual, and all the dishes were still in the sink, and all the laundry was all in the bed."
SPEAKER_01,94.163,101.559," I couldn't even tell him that I looked online for jobs, which I thought I should be proud of, but I didn't even find a job."
SPEAKER_01,102.362,104.456," So whatever, it's not even that big of a deal."
SPEAKER_01,105.601,114.998," I just thought maybe we could talk about that, but he was just feeling that his shirts need to be ironed, and I just couldn't do any of it."
SPEAKER_00,117.063,131.519," So you feel that even though you made some progress by looking at them for jobs this week,  that you didn't feel much accomplishment from that because your husband didn't acknowledge it or appreciate it."
SPEAKER_01,132.564,134.315," Yeah, he doesn't appreciate anything I do."
SPEAKER_00,135.963,139.355,How does being unappreciated make you feel inside?
SPEAKER_01,141.622,144.009,It just makes my whole body ache.
SPEAKER_01,144.691,145.713,It just makes me feel empty.
SPEAKER_01,148.482,153.518," If he can't appreciate the things that I do, then why would I be motivated to do the things that he wants me to do?"
SPEAKER_01,154.0,158.334,How am I supposed to iron his shirts when I can't even get out of bed in the morning?
SPEAKER_01,160.04,165.496," It just makes me feel really just empty, just miserable."
SPEAKER_00,167.161,176.9," I hear you saying that you're shutting down, and not only do I hear you saying that,  I can see you sitting here with me, with the way you're sitting with your honest cross."
SPEAKER_00,177.12,183.318," I feel like you're closing yourself off to a lot of things, to a lot of people."
SPEAKER_01,184.802,190.519," Yeah, definitely I am because they don't notice anything I do."
SPEAKER_01,192.704,201.952," On Monday, I actually got out of the house, which I thought was a big deal in the moment,  but I took the cat to the groomer."
SPEAKER_01,201.992,204.0,My husband's been bugging me about that for months.
SPEAKER_01,204.382,208.558," I got out of the house, I drove the groomers, I changed in my pajamas."
SPEAKER_01,209.281,213.699," All these things are a big deal to me, but he doesn't even see that as an accomplishment."
SPEAKER_01,214.14,215.124,They didn't even notice.
SPEAKER_01,215.144,216.207,My daughter didn't notice either.
SPEAKER_01,216.268,219.237,"She just comes home and slams the door, doesn't even look at me."
SPEAKER_01,220.04,224.859," The cat was all groomed, had a nice little bow, and I haven't even spent five days since then."
SPEAKER_01,225.342,227.295,No one's even said anything since then.
SPEAKER_00,228.541,238.319," So I feel like I've made this huge accomplishment for myself by getting out of the door, even, and taking the cat to the groomers."
SPEAKER_00,239.942,246.116," But then when I get home and it's not noticed by anyone, it takes it all away."
SPEAKER_00,246.156,247.318,It doesn't even matter to me.
SPEAKER_01,248.584,249.128,Exactly.
SPEAKER_01,249.148,250.839,Exactly.
SPEAKER_00,252.0,263.659," So for things to matter to you, and for you to feel good about the even little steps you're making,  you really need to have that acknowledged by your husband and your daughter."
SPEAKER_01,264.461,264.822,Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,265.684,267.789,"I mean, otherwise what's the point?"
SPEAKER_01,267.99,271.98,"You know, if they don't have that support, all they do is point out the things I haven't done."
SPEAKER_01,272.08,275.276,They'll do something that it's all about what hasn't been done.
SPEAKER_01,276.582,279.109," Oh, you haven't vacuumed in two months."
SPEAKER_01,280.072,282.178,But they don't notice the things that I actually do.
SPEAKER_00,283.441,288.799," So I feel, I hear you saying that you're experiencing a lot of hurt."
SPEAKER_01,289.707,289.909,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,291.823,293.609," So Bethany, you're feeling all this hurt."
SPEAKER_00,294.191,296.94,"You're feeling, like, nobody's recognizing who you are."
SPEAKER_00,297.963,301.535," You have all this laundry, vacuuming to do, all these chores."
SPEAKER_00,301.555,303.0,It's a lot.
SPEAKER_00,303.0,308.418," Do you think it's a way for me to put it away somewhere for a little bit, to be able to address other issues?"
SPEAKER_01,309.99,310.475,I could try.
SPEAKER_00,311.461,311.702,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,312.724,317.717,Do you trust me to put it in a little jar and be able to put all that hurt in a little jar?
SPEAKER_01,319.884,320.447,It's hard.
SPEAKER_01,320.467,322.94,It feels like there's so much of it in a little bit.
SPEAKER_00,323.683,325.09,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,325.492,326.96,Do you need a bigger space maybe for it?
SPEAKER_01,327.04,327.303,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,329.883,331.668," Alright, let's try putting it in the corner over here."
SPEAKER_00,332.891,334.235,Let's try one more time.
SPEAKER_01,336.602,337.143,It's hard.
SPEAKER_01,337.183,338.989,It's like it won't disconnect from me.
SPEAKER_01,339.069,341.857,I just can't separate it from myself.
SPEAKER_00,343.762,344.825,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,346.069,347.874,What do you think that hurts trying to tell you?
SPEAKER_01,350.261,350.803,I don't know.
SPEAKER_00,355.221,357.066,Let's take a minute and think about it.
SPEAKER_00,359.593,360.255,We need something.
SPEAKER_01,362.602,365.853,Maybe it's just telling me that it's what I always do.
SPEAKER_01,365.873,366.836,I always try to avoid it.
SPEAKER_00,368.1,368.381,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,372.05,374.717,"Well, let's tell the hurt that the hurt is important."
SPEAKER_00,376.843,379.552,We'll be able to come back to it once you push it away.
SPEAKER_00,379.933,380.916,So it's not going to be there forever.
SPEAKER_00,382.081,383.168,So can we do that?
SPEAKER_01,385.14,386.064,I guess we could try.
SPEAKER_01,386.084,389.395,I just know it's trying to tell me that it's not going to work.
SPEAKER_01,392.926,395.453," It's just, yeah, I feel like it's just what I always do with it."
SPEAKER_01,395.473,396.676,I always just try to avoid it.
SPEAKER_00,398.963,399.144,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,399.204,400.709,"Alright, well, let's try doing this."
SPEAKER_00,401.05,402.535,Let's try closing your eyes.
SPEAKER_00,404.301,405.987,We'll do some breathing exercises here.
SPEAKER_00,406.247,407.552,Take a deep breath in.
SPEAKER_00,410.0,410.782,Deep breath out.
SPEAKER_00,413.028,413.91,Deep breath in.
SPEAKER_00,415.995,416.697,Deep breath out.
SPEAKER_00,418.742,423.716," Imagine all the laundry, the husband, the daughter, the cat."
SPEAKER_00,425.0,428.313," Let's put it outside in the hallway, the very bottom of the hallway."
SPEAKER_00,430.1,430.522,Breathe in.
SPEAKER_00,430.562,434.395,Breathe out.
SPEAKER_00,436.281,436.441,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,436.461,438.527,Open your eyes.
SPEAKER_00,438.547,440.593,How does that feel?
SPEAKER_01,443.621,450.276," I guess I'm feeling a little bit more relaxed, but I still don't feel good."
SPEAKER_00,453.709,455.719,Is it in the hallway or are you still hanging on to it?
SPEAKER_01,456.924,460.518," I guess it's in the hallway now, just different things kind of coming up."
SPEAKER_00,461.441,462.524,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,462.544,464.269,So what are you feeling?
SPEAKER_00,464.41,465.734,What do you want to talk about?
SPEAKER_01,468.523,469.809," Oh, no, I guess I'm kind of lost."
SPEAKER_01,469.829,471.055,What should I talk about?
SPEAKER_00,472.782,473.884,I don't have an agenda today.
SPEAKER_00,474.566,477.653,"So whatever comes to mind, whatever you feel is important."
SPEAKER_01,481.362,482.146,I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,482.226,484.558,Do you have any suggestions?
SPEAKER_00,485.481,486.623,We'll take a minute.
SPEAKER_00,486.943,487.664,We'll think about it.
SPEAKER_00,491.811,492.553,Close your eyes again.
SPEAKER_00,497.18,498.504,Think about what you're feeling.
SPEAKER_00,498.524,503.877,So what are you feeling right now?
SPEAKER_01,505.882,511.897,I guess what it really is is I feel guilty for even letting go of that hurt.
SPEAKER_01,513.12,517.254,Like I need that hurt or that hurt makes me feel guilty.
SPEAKER_01,517.314,518.358,Like I shouldn't be hurting.
SPEAKER_01,519.02,527.96,Like part of me needs the hurt and part of me just feels so bad for even hurting that I should be taking it on my own.
SPEAKER_01,528.483,529.671,I just feel a lot of guilt.
SPEAKER_00,531.461,534.006,So you feel guilty and you hurt.
SPEAKER_00,534.587,538.255,I'm not worthy of feeling hurt.
SPEAKER_00,538.315,540.579,I'm not worthy of feeling good.
SPEAKER_01,541.842,542.944," Yeah, exactly."
SPEAKER_01,543.004,546.711,It's like I feel guilty for even feeling hurt.
SPEAKER_01,547.593,550.599,But I feel guilty for feeling good.
SPEAKER_01,551.181,556.616," It's like I don't deserve happiness, but I know I probably deserve to feel better."
SPEAKER_01,558.282,559.893," It's just no matter what, I just feel guilty."
SPEAKER_01,561.0,561.241,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,561.942,565.831,So I want to kind of delve into that a little bit.
SPEAKER_00,565.871,569.599,That guilt that you're feeling that's arising into this hurt.
SPEAKER_00,570.0,571.495,Are you going to be willing to try something with me?
SPEAKER_01,572.202,573.636," Yeah, sure."
SPEAKER_00,574.261,574.662,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,574.682,581.298,So what I'm going to do is I want you to think about this chair.
SPEAKER_00,582.0,584.687,I want you to picture yourself over here.
SPEAKER_00,585.489,591.967,This is the side of you that says you don't deserve to be able to feel guilty  and that you don't deserve to be hurt.
SPEAKER_00,592.288,594.836,So I want you to focus on yourself.
SPEAKER_00,597.183,601.353,Tell yourself about how it makes you feel to be guilty.
SPEAKER_01,605.403,611.876,I just feel like I feel guilty for hurting because it forces me to just stay in bed.
SPEAKER_01,614.221,615.686,And it makes me feel hurt.
SPEAKER_01,616.849,619.839,It makes me feel like I'm incapable of taking care of my family.
SPEAKER_01,621.087,622.376,I need to take care of my family.
SPEAKER_01,624.385,626.431,I just feel guilty because I'm hurting.
SPEAKER_01,626.512,627.334,I can't do that.
SPEAKER_01,627.355,628.378,I can't be there for them.
SPEAKER_00,629.283,630.535,I closed down when I'm hurt.
SPEAKER_01,631.424,631.525,Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,633.784,635.915,And I deserve more than being hurt.
SPEAKER_00,638.027,640.0,And you deserve more than being hurt.
SPEAKER_01,640.785,641.953,I deserve more than being hurt.
SPEAKER_00,643.909,645.0,And you want to be there for your family.
SPEAKER_01,645.02,647.799,I want to be there for my family.
SPEAKER_00,649.0,650.576,Do you want to share?
SPEAKER_01,651.081,651.889,I want to share.
SPEAKER_00,659.0,662.112,You don't deserve to be... feel guilty about being hurt.
SPEAKER_01,665.045,667.377,You don't deserve to feel guilty about being hurt.
SPEAKER_00,668.06,671.876,You need to take care of your family and stop being so selfish.
SPEAKER_01,673.04,674.57,You need to stop being so selfish.
SPEAKER_01,674.872,675.779,Your family needs you.
SPEAKER_01,676.705,677.691,You've got to take care of them.
SPEAKER_00,679.161,684.358," And when you don't take care of them, they get upset."
SPEAKER_01,689.502,691.088,That's why they're always mad at you.
SPEAKER_01,691.108,692.635,Because you don't take care of them.
SPEAKER_01,692.655,693.317,You're selfish.
SPEAKER_01,696.49,697.436,I'm not going to go back there.
SPEAKER_00,701.802,707.117,How does it make you feel when yourself tells you that you're selfish?
SPEAKER_01,709.447,710.07,It hurts.
SPEAKER_01,711.236,712.0,It's really sad.
SPEAKER_01,713.807,714.41,I'm sad.
SPEAKER_00,714.43,716.538,It makes me... it hurts me more.
SPEAKER_01,718.563,721.095,It hurts me when you tell me I'm selfish.
SPEAKER_01,722.261,724.972,When you tell me I'm not there for my family or I don't care about things.
SPEAKER_01,725.072,726.498,I do care about them so much.
SPEAKER_01,727.503,728.268,I'm trying my best.
SPEAKER_00,731.422,735.578,Why are you making me feel guilty about being hurt?
SPEAKER_00,736.362,739.136,I... I have needs too.
SPEAKER_01,741.045,743.578,I have needs I need to be taken care of too.
SPEAKER_01,744.563,745.347,I can't help being hurt.
SPEAKER_00,748.401,749.986,And you're not taking care of me.
SPEAKER_00,750.407,754.759,You're not allowing me to feel good.
SPEAKER_01,755.564,757.094,You're not allowing me to feel good.
SPEAKER_01,758.08,761.739,I'm feeling selfish and doesn't allow me to feel good.
SPEAKER_01,762.06,763.671,I can't even be there for my family.
SPEAKER_01,766.0,766.805,I can't even feel good.
SPEAKER_00,770.421,779.198,How does it feel when you hear that you're hurt... that... that hurts and the pain that you're feeling?
SPEAKER_01,783.301,788.559,It just feels like I need to... I need to step it up and I need to try even harder.
SPEAKER_00,790.0,790.26,Okay.
SPEAKER_00,791.142,802.92,"So when you tell yourself that I'm hurt and then you tell yourself I'm selfish, how does that feel inside?"
SPEAKER_01,806.06,807.243,It's just really confusing.
SPEAKER_01,807.263,814.579,It's like I need to break out of this guilty feeling and just allow myself to hurt.
SPEAKER_00,815.923,816.805,I deserve to hurt.
SPEAKER_00,816.825,820.456,I need to hurt sometimes.
SPEAKER_00,821.358,821.9,And it's okay.
SPEAKER_01,824.403,826.919,I need to hurt sometimes and that's okay.
SPEAKER_00,829.024,832.839,I deserve to have my needs met as well.
SPEAKER_01,833.866,835.235,I deserve to have my needs met as well.
SPEAKER_00,844.31,852.259,So how does it make you feel that your other self understands that you're hurt?
SPEAKER_01,855.802,859.491,Actually it does.
SPEAKER_01,859.591,861.637,I mean it's still hurting but it's on my side.
SPEAKER_01,862.158,862.98,It's okay to hurt now.
SPEAKER_00,864.124,867.578,I feel better that you're allowing me to hurt.
SPEAKER_01,869.463,871.013,I feel better that you're allowing me to hurt.
SPEAKER_00,873.101,875.477,I feel validated.
SPEAKER_01,879.869,880.535,I feel validated.
SPEAKER_00,884.903,890.0,I need to help my family.
SPEAKER_01,890.341,893.449,I need to help my family.
SPEAKER_01,893.529,897.84,I need to hurt and show them that I'm hurting but not feel guilty about it.
SPEAKER_01,899.221,902.92,That way I can be there for them and they can really understand what's going on with them.
SPEAKER_00,904.04,904.383,I need you.
SPEAKER_00,904.403,905.47,I need things too.
SPEAKER_01,908.282,909.53," Yeah, I need things too."
SPEAKER_01,909.812,910.617,I have needs too.
SPEAKER_00,913.164,917.097,So how do you feel inside right now?
SPEAKER_01,920.465,924.98,I almost feel things feel lighter like some of that guilt is gone.
SPEAKER_01,926.241,932.94,Even I'm still really hurt and I feel really sad but it just feels more okay to feel that way.
SPEAKER_00,941.189,958.835," When you hear that you need things and it's okay to be hurt and I need to be validated,  tell yourself how you can maybe do that."
SPEAKER_00,959.877,960.439,Can you allow it?
SPEAKER_01,963.161,964.365," Yeah, I think I can allow that."
SPEAKER_01,965.41,967.237,I can feel hurt without feeling guilty.
SPEAKER_01,969.02,970.284,I can feel okay about hurting.
SPEAKER_01,970.304,974.398,I can talk about hurting without feeling guilty about it.
SPEAKER_01,976.367,976.837,It's okay to hurt.
SPEAKER_00,978.06,981.739,And it doesn't make me selfish to be things.
SPEAKER_01,983.0,985.134," Yeah, it doesn't make me selfish to be things."
SPEAKER_00,988.763,1000.559,So now you can come to an agreement with yourself to allow that space to hurt without the guilt?
SPEAKER_01,1002.663,1006.297," Yeah, well that's sad."
SPEAKER_00,1009.128,1010.879,So we're actually out of time for today.
SPEAKER_00,1012.601,1022.0,So I want you to take this awareness with you this week and then we'll kick up again next week.
