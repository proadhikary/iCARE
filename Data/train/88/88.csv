SPEAKER_00,0.0,0.181," Hi, Jackie."
SPEAKER_00,0.201,0.662,How are you doing today?
SPEAKER_01,14.674,15.576," I'm pretty good, yes."
SPEAKER_01,16.617,17.539,How about you?
SPEAKER_00,18.02,19.785, I'm doing okay.
SPEAKER_00,19.825,20.547,Thanks for asking.
SPEAKER_00,21.57,27.874,I understand you've been having some difficulties that  have facilitated you to come into our agency.
SPEAKER_01,29.04,37.759," Yeah, well, I mean I've been drinking a lot more than usual, but it's kind of just part of my life."
SPEAKER_01,38.582,43.516," But I don't know, I think there is an increase, so it's worrying me a little bit."
SPEAKER_00,46.143,49.069, So you feel like you're drinking more than usual?
SPEAKER_00,51.174,52.497,How much are you drinking now?
SPEAKER_01,55.062,63.098," I go out with my friends a couple nights a week, and then about once a week I'll go out with my co-workers."
SPEAKER_01,64.06,67.976," So, yeah, maybe three, four nights a week."
SPEAKER_00,69.0,69.98, Three or four nights a week you're drinking?
SPEAKER_01,70.0,70.163, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,71.322,73.633, And how much are you drinking each time you go out?
SPEAKER_01,76.143,83.98," It kind of depends on who I'm with, but usually when I go out with my friends on the weekend I'll stay for a pretty long time."
SPEAKER_01,84.02,99.0," I mean, I think the problem is when I'm going out during the week with my co-workers, I'll stay longer than I want to,  and then when I have to get up in the morning it's kind of like, ugh, I should have gone home a little earlier."
SPEAKER_01,99.261,103.372," But, no, they're all out with me, so when I get there they understand."
SPEAKER_00,106.501,106.682, All right.
SPEAKER_00,107.183,116.893,"So do you know how much alcohol, like you were talking about the time period,  do you know how much you're actually drinking each night approximately?"
SPEAKER_01,119.702,129.899," Well, before I used to drink maybe two beers an hour, but they really like to party, so, and I'm trying to keep up with them, so"
SPEAKER_00,130.612,130.98, You're friends?
SPEAKER_01,131.121,131.525, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,133.12,138.614," So I've been drinking a shot with the beers I have, so maybe like three or four drinks an hour."
SPEAKER_00,141.181,146.095, Do you find that you need to drink more to get the desired effect?
SPEAKER_01,148.842,165.0," Yeah, you know, everyone else is getting to that level, so I feel like I need to keep up with them,  and usually before I would get that from maybe one or two drinks, so now I've been drinking a little bit more, I think, to get there."
SPEAKER_00,165.843,169.98, Have you made any attempts to cut down on the consumption?
SPEAKER_01,170.562,176.719," You know, at the beginning of the week I would kind of say, you know, I'm only going to go out twice this week."
SPEAKER_01,177.542,183.599," But then they invite me and I'm kind of like, oh, well, I don't want to miss out, they're my friends, you know."
SPEAKER_01,185.161,188.594," This might show my social time during the week, so I usually go."
SPEAKER_01,188.614,190.0,I don't really stick to the plan.
SPEAKER_01,190.521,198.619," So that's kind of been a little frustrating, but I don't know, I still think it's okay."
SPEAKER_00,199.381,204.699, So I want to talk about the time you spent using alcohol.
SPEAKER_00,205.301,206.745, Are you okay with the amount of time?
SPEAKER_00,206.765,211.579,"You mentioned that you're using it for a longer period, but are you okay with that?"
SPEAKER_00,212.0,214.436, Or is that something that's distressing you?
SPEAKER_01,216.123,223.0," You know, I think I could probably be doing better things with my time, but this is not a huge problem."
SPEAKER_01,223.361,226.976," I think a lot of people do it, so, you know."
SPEAKER_00,228.482,231.296, Do you find that you have a craving for alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,232.808,233.758," Yeah, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,234.429,234.918, Tell me about that.
SPEAKER_01,235.2,252.619," I would say, like, when I'm at work, I'm just ready to get finished so I can go to happy hour with my co-workers,  or, you know, if I'm just kind of at a barbecue or something with family, think about how I want a beer."
SPEAKER_01,253.842,259.559," So, yeah, I have cravings, but, you know, everyone kind of does that, like, oh, I could go for a beer right now."
SPEAKER_00,260.181,263.554," So you're thinking about it, but you're also feeling the craving?"
SPEAKER_01,265.201,267.758," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,268.06,268.321, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,269.223,269.865,You mentioned work.
SPEAKER_00,270.266,274.9,Are you having trouble with responsibilities at work or any other area?
SPEAKER_01,275.762,278.57," No, my work life has been pretty, going pretty well."
SPEAKER_01,278.59,281.579,"I haven't missed work because of it or anything like that, so."
SPEAKER_00,282.0,282.551, Because of the drinking?
SPEAKER_01,283.122,283.469, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,284.0,284.724, All right.
SPEAKER_00,284.744,286.814,How about any social problems due to the alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,288.321,297.0," No, I think my social life is actually great because of it, you know, hanging out with my friends and we all get along really well, so, yeah, it's my social time."
SPEAKER_00,297.121,298.939," All right, so no social problems?"
SPEAKER_01,299.102,299.878," No, no problems."
SPEAKER_00,300.522,303.893, Have you had to give up any important activities because of the alcohol use?
SPEAKER_01,306.501,312.158," Important activities, well, usually the important activities involve drinking, so."
SPEAKER_01,313.361,320.639," I haven't given up important activities that don't involve drinking, but that's been pretty easy because there's usually alcohol at the important things, so."
SPEAKER_00,321.423,323.617, I see you haven't missed any important activities because of that.
SPEAKER_00,325.243,331.178, How about engaging in any activities that are physically dangerous because alcohol is involved?
SPEAKER_01,332.725,335.0," No, no, I'm usually pretty safe, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,335.327,335.531, Safe?
SPEAKER_01,336.323,336.525, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,338.402,342.538, Do you have any medical or mental health history?
SPEAKER_01,345.483,357.619," Well, like when I was a kid I was diagnosed with, I think, maybe ADHD or something like that, but I think my teachers were annoyed by me because I just like to have a good time, so."
SPEAKER_01,359.409,361.0, But that's not really been an issue lately.
SPEAKER_00,361.02,361.98, That's not been an issue?
SPEAKER_01,362.061,362.143, No.
SPEAKER_00,364.562,368.659, Has any medical problem or mental health problem become worse because of the alcohol?
SPEAKER_01,370.165,373.538," No, you know, I started drinking after that, so."
SPEAKER_01,376.751,378.839," No, it's not become an issue with it."
SPEAKER_00,380.508,381.975, So you mentioned alcohol use.
SPEAKER_00,382.055,382.94,Has there been any drug use?
SPEAKER_01,385.243,387.047," No, not with my drinking or anything."
SPEAKER_01,387.067,392.96,"You know, typical teenage smoking marijuana and stuff when I was younger, but I don't anymore, so."
SPEAKER_00,393.0,394.0, So it's just alcohol now?
SPEAKER_01,394.0,394.97," Yeah, just alcohol."
SPEAKER_00,397.884,398.125, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,398.646,404.9,"Do you have, when you stop drinking, do you have any physical symptoms or anxiety, any symptoms of withdrawal?"
SPEAKER_01,406.923,407.264, No.
SPEAKER_01,408.587,410.372,I usually feel fine afterwards.
SPEAKER_01,410.393,412.92,I can go a few days without drinking.
SPEAKER_00,413.0,414.96," Okay, so that's not a problem for you?"
SPEAKER_01,415.286,415.408, No.
SPEAKER_00,416.653,416.857, Alright.
SPEAKER_00,419.045,421.94," Jackie, are you open to receiving counseling services or agency?"
SPEAKER_01,423.023,425.612," Yeah, I don't see why it would hurt anything."
SPEAKER_01,425.632,427.579,"I don't really know if I need it, but."
SPEAKER_00,428.347,428.98, But you'll be okay with trying?
