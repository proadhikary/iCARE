SPEAKER_00,0.0,0.16, Hi Chris.
SPEAKER_01,10.454,10.535, Hi.
SPEAKER_00,11.8,13.993, Thanks for coming in today and filling out our survey.
SPEAKER_00,15.3,19.579, I wonder if it's okay if I go over a couple of the things that you answered in the survey?
SPEAKER_01,19.92,20.43," Yeah, it's fine."
SPEAKER_00,21.389,21.512, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,21.92,28.767, One of the things that I noticed is that you are not using any kind of birth control right  now.
SPEAKER_01,29.9,30.88," Yeah, I'm not."
SPEAKER_00,31.553,31.758, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,31.88,35.518, And I just wondered if we could talk for a few minutes about some ideas.
SPEAKER_00,35.84,38.655, And I wonder what your thoughts are about using condoms.
SPEAKER_01,40.041,50.414," Well, I've heard stuff about them that I don't really need them and they're not going to  do much for me and it's just kind of a hassle to go out and get them."
SPEAKER_00,51.46,53.578, So I don't really use them for that reason.
SPEAKER_00,53.84,55.859, You've heard a lot of negative things about condom usage.
SPEAKER_01,56.47,56.899, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,57.633,57.797, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,58.001,58.348, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,59.48,66.134, I'm just going to share with you some of the things that I've learned about condom usage  and some of the things that my clients that are around your age have shared with me about  condom usage.
SPEAKER_01,66.44,67.073," Yeah, that's fine."
SPEAKER_00,67.44,68.358, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,68.44,81.289," What some people don't realize and don't know about condoms is that they not only prevent  teen pregnancy, but they can also prevent sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia  along with HIV."
SPEAKER_00,83.04,85.39, They're really effective in preventing these things.
SPEAKER_00,88.04,92.297, There's also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don't know.
SPEAKER_00,92.92,96.495, The local health departments have condoms and many times they're free.
SPEAKER_00,97.84,107.612," And local pharmacies, drugstores have condoms and there are a lot of clinics that have them  as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free."
SPEAKER_00,110.36,120.714, And there's some ways too that people have found of carrying them around pretty conveniently  in their car or in their pockets because they're pretty small.
SPEAKER_00,122.96,124.357, What does it sound like as I'm talking?
SPEAKER_00,124.62,127.554, What are some thoughts that are going through your mind?
SPEAKER_01,129.342,132.618, Definitely changing my mind about condoms a little bit.
SPEAKER_01,133.0,135.657, I think there's no hurt in just carrying them with me.
SPEAKER_01,137.765,144.22," And if they do protect against all that stuff that you said, I mean, that sounds a lot better  than what I have heard."
SPEAKER_01,145.061,147.598, I definitely want to avoid all those consequences.
SPEAKER_00,148.021,148.307, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,148.96,151.638," You're not interested in becoming a father right now, I'm guessing."
SPEAKER_01,152.572,152.715, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,153.144,153.389, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,153.98,154.47, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,154.98,155.225, Great.
SPEAKER_00,155.96,170.088," Well, can I ask you, so after this conversation today on a scale of zero to 10 with zero being  that it's not at all important to you and 10 being that it's extremely important, where  do you think you fall with how important taking a chance and using condoms would be to you  now?"
SPEAKER_00,171.36,176.232," After everything that you've told me, it sounds pretty important to me, probably like an eight  or a nine."
SPEAKER_01,176.701,177.334, Eight or nine.
SPEAKER_00,177.803,178.007, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,178.66,178.742, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,179.681,180.64," Well, that's great."
SPEAKER_00,181.084,182.858, It sounds like you really have a plan in mind.
SPEAKER_00,183.16,184.719, What do you think you'll do next?
SPEAKER_00,185.061,189.3, What do you think would be a next step with you as far as contraception and or condoms?
SPEAKER_01,189.963,192.917, Probably go out and look for some condoms.
SPEAKER_00,193.664,193.889, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,194.44,195.216, Have an open mind to them.
SPEAKER_00,195.971,196.134, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,196.46,197.44," Well, we've got some here at the clinic."
SPEAKER_00,197.622,199.299, Would you like me to give you some on your way out?
SPEAKER_00,199.44,199.767, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,200.6,201.559, I'll take them with you.
