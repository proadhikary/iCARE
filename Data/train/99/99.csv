SPEAKER_01,11.472,14.095, So I'd like to talk about being cognitively active.
SPEAKER_01,14.936,17.399,So you're retired now.
SPEAKER_01,17.879,19.063,What did you  used to do?
SPEAKER_00,19.587,20.473,I was a nurse for 44 years.
SPEAKER_01,21.56,21.7, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,22.142,24.449,And presumably that kept you very busy.
SPEAKER_00,25.332,25.794,It did.
SPEAKER_00,26.115,26.476,It did.
SPEAKER_00,26.737,27.519,It wasn't just that.
SPEAKER_00,27.539,31.973,I had  five children and I helped my husband run a post office.
SPEAKER_00,32.755,38.752,So I was working a 70 hour  week in those days because I did two nights night duty.
SPEAKER_00,38.812,45.167,They were 12 hour shifts separated  and then I worked in the shop.
SPEAKER_00,48.914,50.237,So for five years I did that.
SPEAKER_00,50.297,53.814,"So that was, you know, and  looked after the children in the house and that."
SPEAKER_01,55.262,61.079," And do you do any, now that you've retired, do you do any voluntary work or anything else?"
SPEAKER_00,61.401,69.065," Yeah, I've got involved with things around the church with visiting the housebound and  taking them out and things like that."
SPEAKER_00,72.212,83.323,"And I still, and one of my daughters decided to  get me a job as a transport passenger assistant for special needs on the mini buses that go  around needs."
SPEAKER_00,84.205,88.218,"So they were desperate for them and she said, you'd be good at that mum."
SPEAKER_00,88.8,93.05," So that was, she signed me up cause she was the manager."
SPEAKER_00,93.792,94.874,So I did that until I was 77.
SPEAKER_00,97.32,104.097,And I also did the 11 weeks of the stewarding for the ABRSM music exams.
SPEAKER_01,105.1,107.572, Would you say that keeping busy is important to you?
SPEAKER_00,109.18,110.545, Well I'm just a busy person.
SPEAKER_00,111.669,113.194,So it just comes natural to me.
SPEAKER_00,113.274,114.94,I can't sit really for long.
SPEAKER_01,115.121,115.323, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,115.424,116.939,And have you always been like that?
SPEAKER_00,117.02,117.265, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,118.081,118.183, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,119.04,119.285, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,120.02,121.656, Do you have a lot of social support?
SPEAKER_00,122.662,123.244, Yes I do.
SPEAKER_00,123.264,123.344,Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,124.789,129.398,"Well even more so now, now that the children have press ganged me into  Facebook and WhatsApp."
SPEAKER_00,129.622,129.846, Wow.
SPEAKER_00,130.64,134.257," I mean it's just, it's just full on around the world, you know."
SPEAKER_01,135.081,135.344, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,136.071,136.879,You're international friends.
SPEAKER_00,137.081,137.323, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,137.746,138.008,Yes.
SPEAKER_00,138.774,138.975,Yes.
SPEAKER_01,139.942,142.599, And I believe that you are an Airbnb host.
SPEAKER_00,142.841,143.392, Yes I do.
SPEAKER_01,143.78,143.862, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,144.78,145.76, So the world comes to me that way.
SPEAKER_01,146.748,147.272, Excellent.
SPEAKER_01,147.353,148.039,And you enjoy that.
SPEAKER_00,148.22,153.658, And then I'm Facebook friends when they go home apparently in China and Brazil and Rome.
SPEAKER_01,154.322,155.22, Any invitations to visit?
SPEAKER_00,155.281,155.342, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,155.363,155.669,Yes.
SPEAKER_00,155.689,155.914,Brazil.
SPEAKER_00,155.934,156.118,Yes.
SPEAKER_01,156.22,156.281, Wow.
SPEAKER_01,156.302,157.22,And you said you've got grandchildren.
SPEAKER_00,157.22,157.914, And great grandchildren.
SPEAKER_01,158.22,159.22, And great grandchildren. Do you think that intergenerational contact is a good thing?
SPEAKER_00,159.261,160.098, Very important.
SPEAKER_01,160.302,160.424, Why?
SPEAKER_00,161.34,166.126," Because you, when you're busy bringing up children you haven't time to see the world"
SPEAKER_00,178.84,186.039, through their eyes or even really listen to them because you're too busy and preoccupied.
SPEAKER_00,186.62,200.519," But then grandchildren come along and more importantly now great grandchildren and seeing  the world fresh through these new eyes is just, it's quite mind blowing actually."
SPEAKER_00,201.0,201.911, So I've learned a lot.
SPEAKER_00,202.6,206.315, In the old days grandchildren used to learn at their grandparents knee.
SPEAKER_00,207.7,212.78, But nowadays it's the grandparents learning at the grandchildren's knees now.
SPEAKER_01,212.86,213.554," Oh, do you think?"
SPEAKER_00,213.86,214.083, Definitely.
SPEAKER_00,214.103,214.548,Oh yes.
SPEAKER_00,214.993,215.196,Yes.
SPEAKER_01,215.981,222.256," And do you think that it also benefits them to spend time with people of different generations,  different ages?"
SPEAKER_00,223.222,241.912," Well, as I said, they don't use age, you see, which is very releasing because, well, it  just is, you know, after my generation, the way I was brought up to be seen and not heard  and to sit in the parlour with all these old people."
SPEAKER_00,245.06,255.496," And now, well, you're going around flipping parks, you know, the adventure things and  they're saying, come on the slide with us and all this, you know, which I do."
SPEAKER_00,258.434,258.978, Which I do.
SPEAKER_00,259.341,260.514, I don't turn anything down.
SPEAKER_00,261.785,262.935, That's the secret.
SPEAKER_01,263.62,264.334, Not turn anything down.
SPEAKER_00,264.62,264.722, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,265.721,266.476," I say yes, yes."
SPEAKER_01,266.987,267.64, Good philosophy.
SPEAKER_00,267.66,268.333, Except drugs.
SPEAKER_00,268.66,269.619, Try everything once.
SPEAKER_00,269.68,270.354, Try everything once.
SPEAKER_01,272.262,280.655," What's your view on nutrition and kind of, you know, having a so-called healthy diet?"
SPEAKER_00,284.521,290.735," I think the younger generation stress on it too much, far too much."
SPEAKER_00,292.78,307.797,"When you think that if my generation are living to be 100 and we were brought up with  dripping sandwiches, meat with marbling in, etc, etc, full cream milk, all the rest of  it, why get stressed out?"
SPEAKER_00,309.002,314.399," You know, just eat everything in moderation and enjoy life for goodness sake."
SPEAKER_01,316.131,317.059, I like that philosophy.
SPEAKER_00,317.466,317.833, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,318.924,321.096, How do you minimise the effects of stress?
SPEAKER_01,322.322,329.17," Do you have any, you know, did you have any techniques or if something stressful happens,  is there anything particular that you do?"
SPEAKER_00,330.94,332.071, Gin and tonic or wine.
SPEAKER_01,332.98,334.415," Okay, yeah."
SPEAKER_00,336.149,337.419, I've got a very good thing.
SPEAKER_00,337.58,344.256," If I'm really cross with somebody and I'd really like to speak my mind to them, I'm  very good at writing letters."
SPEAKER_00,344.7,358.266," I don't send the letter to them, but I do write it down and get it out of my system  and I keep it in a drawer in case one day I might need to plonk it down in front of  them."
SPEAKER_00,358.98,362.414," But it's, you know, it's off, it's out of my head."
SPEAKER_00,363.9,374.138," And if I need to go to the doctor about anything, I will write down what I want to say to him  because I don't believe they listen to you all the time, especially a woman, if it's  a man doctor."
SPEAKER_00,374.501,378.036," Well, you know, it's her, they think, oh God, it's her again, you know?"
SPEAKER_00,378.98,382.258," So I think, put this down and smile at him."
SPEAKER_00,382.54,383.397, He's got to read it.
SPEAKER_01,383.883,385.879, I think you're in your seventies now.
SPEAKER_00,386.284,386.509, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,388.027,389.559, Do you enjoy being in your seventies?
SPEAKER_01,389.7,393.337," What was your favourite period of, you know, in life?"
SPEAKER_01,394.061,395.497," If you can, if there's an answer to that."
SPEAKER_00,395.74,396.393, No there isn't.
SPEAKER_00,396.801,396.944, Right.
SPEAKER_00,397.74,402.46, You should just enjoy every day as it comes and not get hung up about age.
SPEAKER_01,403.311,403.495, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,403.901,409.057,"Because I'm surrounded by 90 year olds now and honestly, they're like nine years old."
SPEAKER_00,410.02,424.894," We have the biggest laughs and they do the silliest things and you know, we feel as if  we've been set free from actual age, you know, you're a mother, set an example to the children  or you're a daughter, you know."
SPEAKER_01,425.42,433.377," So do you think it makes a difference, kind of moving on from those responsibilities,  kind of times of life?"
SPEAKER_01,433.801,440.637," So when you are looking after your children, is that what you mean by you feel a sense  of relief later?"
SPEAKER_00,441.141,446.939," Yes, because you're not, no one's judging you, except that you're hanging around too long."
SPEAKER_00,449.38,453.58," But apart from that, no, it's good."
SPEAKER_00,453.76,463.374," I mean, I was brought up by a Victorian father who was a bank manager and it was always,  just remember who I am in this town."
SPEAKER_00,464.18,466.154," You know, they were somebody in those days."
SPEAKER_00,466.98,467.89, You're my children.
SPEAKER_00,468.78,470.294, And then I went to a convent grammar.
SPEAKER_00,470.98,472.356," Just remember who you are, girls."
SPEAKER_00,472.74,474.097, You're a convent grammar school girl.
SPEAKER_00,474.3,477.299," You know, so it didn't leave much to sin, did it?"
SPEAKER_00,477.421,478.495, It didn't leave much to...
SPEAKER_01,478.82,479.738, It's a pressure to...
SPEAKER_01,479.82,479.902, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,480.82,480.902, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,481.84,484.299," So yeah, there's all these pressures as you're going through life."
SPEAKER_00,484.42,485.431, So it's nice to be.
SPEAKER_00,486.4,496.091,"My husband died in his 50s, so I had to reinvent myself, which was scary, very scary after  being a wife and mother all those years."
SPEAKER_00,497.46,498.369, But my goodness me.
SPEAKER_01,499.5,505.191, I think it was either earlier this year or last year you did something quite big for  a stranger?
SPEAKER_00,506.546,508.6," Oh, the kidney donation, yes, in February."
SPEAKER_00,508.864,509.66, February this year?
SPEAKER_00,509.884,510.15, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,510.66,512.458, You donated a kidney to a stranger?
SPEAKER_00,512.7,514.034," Yeah, a gentleman, I believe."
SPEAKER_01,514.701,514.844, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,516.14,519.14, How did you decide to do that or find out about that and then decide?
SPEAKER_00,519.281,520.494, I found out on Facebook.
SPEAKER_00,521.201,521.487, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,522.26,530.036," Don't ask me what the heading was, but I'm already, like most people, donated after death,  you know, everything."
SPEAKER_00,531.123,537.33," I mean, I'm leaving my body to leave medical school as well, which hasn't pleased one of  my daughters, but there you go."
SPEAKER_00,539.14,541.158, How can we grieve if you're still hanging around?
SPEAKER_00,541.34,543.694," She said, so, so yes."
SPEAKER_00,544.66,547.775, So some of them were for it and some of them weren't.
SPEAKER_01,549.341,556.279," And going through the transplant, the operation, it's quite a big thing to go through."
SPEAKER_00,557.202,567.155," Well, I think all last year I was doing tests, you know, everything from psychological tests  to all the physical tests and brain scans and everything scanned."
SPEAKER_00,568.78,576.06," It was better than a thousand mile service and I thought, well, I'm doing this for the  right reasons, I know that, but who knows?"
SPEAKER_00,576.1,580.379, They might find something totally wrong with me and that's the way I found out.
SPEAKER_00,580.54,583.215," So it's a win-win situation, I believe."
SPEAKER_00,584.16,593.913,"And you know that if they do accept you, and I was the oldest one that they've ever had,  they said, and it'll last 20 years, apparently, a kidney can last 20 years."
SPEAKER_00,596.74,598.215, That was good.
SPEAKER_00,598.921,601.214, So it's a win-win.
SPEAKER_01,602.381,607.499, I think I've asked most things on my list that I wanted to talk about.
SPEAKER_01,607.9,615.311, Is there anything that you think that I've missed that is worth covering in terms of  the theme of living well for longer?
SPEAKER_00,618.723,632.014," Well, I think if you can do something for somebody else, for whatever reason, however  tiny, the comeback to yourself is just huge."
SPEAKER_00,634.22,638.073," But as long as you don't look for that comeback, but it just is."
SPEAKER_00,640.18,661.26," And it also consolidates the reason why you're still alive, that you're not just taking up  space on the planet, and that you should do something, like in January, hopefully,  tandem parachute jump for Alzheimer's."
SPEAKER_01,662.047,662.712," Oh, is that the plan?"
SPEAKER_00,663.66,664.526,That's the plan when I'm 80.
SPEAKER_01,667.333,667.538, Right.
SPEAKER_01,667.741,668.953, To raise money for Alzheimer's.
SPEAKER_00,669.66,670.109, For Alzheimer's.
SPEAKER_01,670.66,671.933, Tandem jump out of the plane.
SPEAKER_00,672.884,673.66," Yeah, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,673.68,673.762, Wow.
SPEAKER_00,674.966,675.15, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,675.68,678.537, That's really good.
SPEAKER_01,679.06,686.577,"Is there any advice that you would give to yourself, age 20, or any of our students?"
SPEAKER_00,688.0,689.9, Not to have taken life so seriously.
SPEAKER_01,690.022,690.246, Right.
SPEAKER_00,691.041,692.851," Well, one, you don't know how long you're here for."
SPEAKER_00,694.581,698.739," And two, nobody's that important."
SPEAKER_00,698.9,702.133," You know, you're not the centre of the universe, for goodness sake."
SPEAKER_00,703.8,705.35, So just get on with things.
SPEAKER_00,707.0,711.796," It's like, I feel sorry with Facebook, you know, if they don't get enough likes."
SPEAKER_00,712.96,716.476," You know, it must ruin the day, some people."
SPEAKER_00,718.186,719.778," Well, this is all false."
SPEAKER_00,720.0,721.474, It's all smoke and murder.
SPEAKER_00,722.16,731.034," One thing a friend did say to me that was very important, and I very proudly was saying  that I now owned my own house, you see."
SPEAKER_00,731.96,734.578," And she just laughed and she said, do you think you'd, really?"
SPEAKER_00,735.365,736.777," I went, yes, you know."
SPEAKER_00,737.725,739.277," Oh, you're taking it with you, are you?"
SPEAKER_00,740.022,742.777," She said, you don't own anything, she said."
SPEAKER_00,743.28,744.549," Smoke and mirrors, all of it."
SPEAKER_00,746.08,747.167," And it's true, isn't it?"
SPEAKER_00,749.241,751.354, So just laugh and get on with it.
SPEAKER_01,753.233,753.639, Thank you.
