SPEAKER_00,14.218,15.24," Hi, this is Dr. Grande."
SPEAKER_00,15.681,17.234, I hope you find this video useful.
SPEAKER_00,17.96,20.956," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel."
SPEAKER_00,21.76,23.144," As always, thanks for watching."
SPEAKER_00,28.18,34.637, Has it made you rethink your entire job and the profession you're in?
SPEAKER_01,35.96,44.58," Yeah, I mean, it's making me think like, you know, if I just had some desk job, like if  I just crunched numbers or something, I would never have to have this responsibility."
SPEAKER_01,44.701,48.759," Like, why would they trust me with a job like this?"
SPEAKER_01,48.98,55.708," Like I'm just a human being who, you know, doesn't know any better than any other person  and I just don't know if I can do this."
SPEAKER_01,58.42,70.43," It's just so much responsibility and I guess, I guess before I felt like I could handle  it and now I just feel like it's so much responsibility for one person and I don't think that I can  handle it anymore."
SPEAKER_01,71.42,78.836, But I don't want to change jobs because I've been here for so long and I liked it before  and I don't know.
SPEAKER_00,79.481,81.337, You're fearful of this happening again.
SPEAKER_01,81.862,82.936," Yes, yes."
SPEAKER_00,83.34,85.756," And how you may handle it, what may happen."
SPEAKER_01,86.44,89.82, I feel like it's just around the corner and this isn't even resolved.
SPEAKER_01,89.9,108.999," I'm still afraid of the consequences of this, you know, like what if, you know, these kids  are out of their parents' home and I just feel like what if something bad happens to  them where they are now and then that's going to fall on me and, you know, people like other,  my coworkers know that I'm the one that did this."
SPEAKER_01,109.18,114.547," So like if something happens to the kids, like I'm going to be the one that they're  going to blame for it."
SPEAKER_00,116.94,129.318," So just to make sure I understand, your report, so they were engaging these behaviors and  your report is what precipitated them being broken up?"
SPEAKER_01,130.061,137.069," Yeah, because, you know, before that, I guess, you know, probably nobody else would have  known about it."
SPEAKER_01,138.101,142.718," So I made the report about what was going on and I think, yeah, as a direct result."
SPEAKER_00,144.664,150.04," All right, let's take a look at the evidence, right?"
SPEAKER_00,150.3,158.101," So in CBT, we like to evaluate evidence and try to look at the facts as we understand  them."
SPEAKER_00,160.54,170.872, Really we want to scrutinize and carefully review the facts and evidence and hold a light  to it and try to figure out what's going on.
SPEAKER_00,172.78,179.815, What would have happened with this family if you hadn't or if no one intervened?
SPEAKER_01,182.602,182.969, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,183.5,186.18," I mean, it wasn't going great for the kids."
SPEAKER_01,186.38,194.154," It wasn't really a great environment, but I just feel like if I had left it alone, I  don't know that the kids would be with their parents."
SPEAKER_00,195.46,196.265, So they'd all be together.
SPEAKER_00,198.62,206.224," And you feel like right now, you think with them being apart, that's not as good as if  they were together."
SPEAKER_01,208.001,214.64," Yeah, I mean, I guess I feel like it probably wasn't great for them to be there."
SPEAKER_01,214.7,215.937," I mean, that's why I made the report."
SPEAKER_01,216.18,216.568, That's my job.
SPEAKER_01,217.18,220.779," But it just feels like, you know, I just feels like I'm playing God."
SPEAKER_01,220.94,221.491, You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_01,221.94,229.011," Like that I'm just coming in here and spend like five, 10 minutes with a family and then  to turn their whole world upside down."
SPEAKER_00,230.68,232.851, You have a tremendous amount of power.
SPEAKER_00,234.7,239.139," And if you misuse that power, you could devastate families."
SPEAKER_00,239.34,240.854, That's maybe what you think happened here.
SPEAKER_01,241.641,241.845, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,243.274,243.58, All right.
SPEAKER_00,243.58,248.071," So going back to what would have happened to them, let me just step back there for a  moment."
SPEAKER_00,248.681,252.18, They would still be together without your intervention.
SPEAKER_00,252.18,253.449, And that could be a positive.
SPEAKER_00,255.1,258.718, What about consequences that may be more negative?
SPEAKER_01,259.763,262.959," Well, I mean, like I said, I thought they were using drugs in the home."
SPEAKER_01,263.14,278.339," So that's like a really dangerous situation for kids to be in because you don't know what  kind of people are coming in and out of the home, if the parents are going to be, you  know, coherent enough to help them if there's an emergency or if the parents are even making  them food and taking care of their needs and stuff like that."
SPEAKER_01,278.54,282.519," So I guess in that sense, that's really concerning."
SPEAKER_01,282.78,285.374, And that's a big part of the reason why I made the report.
SPEAKER_00,287.482,293.956," So you made the report because it's your responsibility, but also you had concerns about their welfare."
SPEAKER_01,297.018,297.099, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,297.14,300.851," If you could go back and do it again, would you change anything?"
SPEAKER_01,303.862,304.209, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,304.78,309.611," I guess that's just the hardest part for me is like, I feel like I can't make the right  decision."
SPEAKER_01,310.06,314.016, I just feel like I don't know if I'm equipped to be the person to make that kind of decision.
SPEAKER_00,314.98,321.174," So you don't know if you made a good decision or not, and further, you question your ability  going forward to make decisions."
SPEAKER_01,322.309,323.0," Yeah, definitely."
SPEAKER_00,323.02,326.119," And that's the uncertainty, the anxiety."
