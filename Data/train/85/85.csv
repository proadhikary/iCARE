SPEAKER_00," Hi, this is Dr. Grande.",7.197,8.219
SPEAKER_00, I hope you find this video useful.,8.66,10.234
SPEAKER_00," If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel.",11.0,13.936
SPEAKER_00," As always, thanks for watching.",14.78,16.147
SPEAKER_00," Hello, Peggy.",18.48,18.702
SPEAKER_00, How are you doing today?,23.47,24.616
SPEAKER_00," Hi, Dr. Grande.",25.5,26.051
SPEAKER_01, I'm okay.,26.868,27.174
SPEAKER_00, You're okay?,27.643,28.46
SPEAKER_01, I am.,28.48,28.643
SPEAKER_00," Yesterday, when you were here at the agency, you took a few different tests.",29.96,34.36
SPEAKER_00, Do you remember that?,34.401,35.36
SPEAKER_01, I did.,35.87,36.136
SPEAKER_00," One of the tests that you took is called the SCL-90, the symptom checklist 90.",37.022,42.939
SPEAKER_00, Do you remember taking that test?,43.722,44.81
SPEAKER_01, I think so.,46.402,46.932
SPEAKER_00, It's 90 items and they're ranked.,47.803,50.497
SPEAKER_01, Ask me like true and false questions.,51.101,52.7
SPEAKER_00, They're not true and false.,53.084,53.994
SPEAKER_00, They're numbers that you select.,54.54,55.557
SPEAKER_01," Oh, okay.",55.781,56.271
SPEAKER_01, I do remember that.,56.72,57.516
SPEAKER_00, Remember that?,57.74,58.373
SPEAKER_00," So, I have the results from that test and I want to review some of those findings with  you.",59.02,68.258
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,68.421,69.013
SPEAKER_00, Is that all right?,69.584,70.013
SPEAKER_01, Sure.,70.993,71.238
SPEAKER_00," So, this particular instrument has a number of what we refer to as subscales.",71.36,76.959
SPEAKER_00," So, these are areas that are measured by the instrument.",78.182,83.776
SPEAKER_00," For example, depression or anxiety.",85.24,87.718
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,88.042,88.511
SPEAKER_00," So, I'm going to review a few of these subscales, ones where you scored a little higher than  we might expect.",89.161,95.594
SPEAKER_00, I'll just review those with you and see what you think and we can talk about it.,96.282,99.859
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,100.509,100.774
SPEAKER_01, Are you recording this?,101.08,101.672
SPEAKER_00, I'm not.,102.223,102.488
SPEAKER_00, Are you worried about that?,103.968,104.815
SPEAKER_01," Well, I think you probably are, but okay.",106.926,109.276
SPEAKER_00, What makes you think I'm recording it?,110.3,111.411
SPEAKER_01, Because that happens to me a lot.,112.38,113.65
SPEAKER_00, It happens to you a lot that you get recorded?,114.92,116.415
SPEAKER_01," I think so, yes.",117.002,117.675
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,118.614,118.798
SPEAKER_00, Do you remember the last time that happened to you?,118.92,120.194
SPEAKER_01, Probably yesterday.,120.68,121.19
SPEAKER_00, And do you think you were recorded while you were taking this?,121.7,123.656
SPEAKER_01," Probably, yes.",124.08,124.488
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,125.958,126.08
SPEAKER_00, All right.,126.121,126.366
SPEAKER_00, That sounds worrisome.,127.243,128.019
SPEAKER_00, That's a feeling you get a lot that you're being recorded?,128.08,129.612
SPEAKER_01, I worry about it a lot.,130.722,131.618
SPEAKER_00, You worry about it a lot.,131.72,132.475
SPEAKER_01, But I know it's happening.,133.085,134.059
SPEAKER_01, That's why I worry about it.,134.16,135.599
SPEAKER_00, You're certain that's happening?,135.68,136.558
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I am.",136.986,137.68
SPEAKER_00, All right.,137.7,137.925
SPEAKER_00," Well, you're not being recorded now.",138.942,140.799
SPEAKER_01," I know it probably feels like you are, but you're not.",141.262,143.577
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,144.424,144.689
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,145.281,145.648
SPEAKER_00, But I appreciate you bringing up that concern with me.,146.662,148.33
SPEAKER_00," So a few of the scales where you were a bit elevated on, I want to discuss, as I mentioned.",150.48,157.018
SPEAKER_00, I need to explain the concept of percentile rank to you.,157.941,162.558
SPEAKER_00, Okay?,163.388,163.592
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,164.388,164.592
SPEAKER_00," Is that a term you've ever heard, percentile rank?",165.0,166.334
SPEAKER_01, I think so in school.,167.244,168.075
SPEAKER_00," Maybe in school, right.",168.603,169.375
SPEAKER_00, That would make sense.,169.963,170.59
SPEAKER_00," So say, for instance, you had a percentile rank of 65%, right, percentile.",171.7,177.711
SPEAKER_00, That would mean that your score is equal to or higher than 65% of the people that took  that test.,182.8,190.712
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,191.977,192.079
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,192.426,193.059
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,193.181,193.344
SPEAKER_00," So if you took a test on math or English and you were at, say, 75 percentile, you'd be  higher than three-quarters of the people that took the test, 75 percentile.",194.72,208.418
SPEAKER_01, I think I understand that.,209.242,210.517
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,210.78,211.658
SPEAKER_01, I think so.,211.862,212.393
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,212.923,213.148
SPEAKER_00," If you want me to come back to that later, just let me know as I go through if it doesn't  make sense.",214.223,217.509
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,218.202,218.753
SPEAKER_00, All right.,219.141,220.08
SPEAKER_00," So areas here on the SCL results where you were a bit higher than we would normally see,  one is the phobic anxiety scale.",220.4,231.874
SPEAKER_00," On that one, you were about 64 percentile.",233.12,234.67
SPEAKER_00, So your score was as high or higher than 64% of people that would take it.,237.082,243.417
SPEAKER_01, To more than half the people in the population.,244.78,247.076
SPEAKER_00, More than half the people in the same situation as you in outpatient mental health treatment.,247.76,253.959
SPEAKER_01, So I have more phobic anxiety than most people.,254.24,257.617
SPEAKER_00, It does seem that way.,258.2,258.97
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,259.76,259.882
SPEAKER_00," So this construct would measure things like being afraid of going out, being afraid of  being in crowds.",260.8,265.971
SPEAKER_00, Does that connect with you?,266.56,267.919
SPEAKER_00, Does that seem like a fear that you have?,267.96,269.718
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,269.96,270.144
SPEAKER_00, Can you tell me about that?,270.96,271.674
SPEAKER_01, I don't like being on public transportation.,272.563,274.332
SPEAKER_01, Crowds make me nervous.,276.46,277.548
SPEAKER_01," And if I ever have to public speak, I feel like I'm just going to pass out.",279.42,282.251
SPEAKER_00, All right.,284.603,284.869
SPEAKER_00, So it does appear that you have kind of phobic anxiety symptoms.,285.46,288.395
SPEAKER_00," So that score, that 64 percentile, that kind of makes sense.",289.36,292.77
SPEAKER_01, I kind of get that.,296.202,297.293
SPEAKER_01, I get that.,298.081,298.53
SPEAKER_00, All right.,299.06,299.346
SPEAKER_00," I want to move on to the next one, which is paranoia.",300.983,304.436
SPEAKER_00," So in this one, you were at the 84th percentile.",305.7,309.654
SPEAKER_00, So quite a bit higher.,311.2,312.91
SPEAKER_01, Is that where you were recording me?,314.56,315.907
SPEAKER_00, This wasn't recorded.,318.421,319.033
SPEAKER_00, Nothing was recorded here.,319.36,320.136
SPEAKER_00, I understand that's a worry that you have.,321.066,322.537
SPEAKER_01, Are you going to share those results with anybody?,323.423,325.492
SPEAKER_00," In your particular case, the only people that would be shared with is the rest of the treatment  team and anybody that you sign a release for.",327.08,335.316
SPEAKER_01," But if the government asked you, you'd have to give them those results?",336.2,339.495
SPEAKER_00, There's no reason right now why I did that.,340.48,342.959
SPEAKER_00," There are certain limits to confidentiality, but in your situation here at this clinic,  there's no reason I would share this information with the government or anybody else other  than the people I indicated.",343.08,352.471
SPEAKER_00, So the rest of the people here would treat you.,353.4,354.972
SPEAKER_00," And if you wanted to release the results to somebody, you could sign a release, and I  would let them have the results.",356.08,361.227
SPEAKER_00, Are you worried about the results getting to other people?,363.944,366.193
SPEAKER_01," Well, I'm worried that I know people are recording me, and I think that that result shows that  I know that's happening.",368.602,376.053
SPEAKER_01, And now you want to make it look like that means I have a problem when I'm just reporting  what I know is true.,376.7,382.73
SPEAKER_00," All right, so you're worried that we're trying to prove that you're paranoid.",385.022,391.119
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,391.482,391.748
SPEAKER_00, And kind of rigging the results of this test to make it,392.843,400.097
SPEAKER_01, But this test says that I'm wrong to think that it makes me paranoid.,401.623,405.878
SPEAKER_00," Oh, I understand.",407.708,408.433
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,409.503,409.809
SPEAKER_00," So, these things are really happening.",410.662,412.979
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,414.133,414.256
SPEAKER_00, Right?,414.48,414.704
SPEAKER_00, But the test is arranged so that it's making you look paranoid when you're not.,415.56,418.975
SPEAKER_01, Exactly.,420.061,420.918
SPEAKER_00, Because it's not paranoia in your case.,421.424,423.019
SPEAKER_00, It's really true.,423.344,423.976
SPEAKER_01, Exactly.,424.282,424.691
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,425.16,425.242
SPEAKER_00, So that would explain why your score is elevated on this scale.,426.16,428.997
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,429.621,429.927
SPEAKER_00, Is that what you're thinking?,430.56,431.56
SPEAKER_01," I do, yes.",431.601,432.315
SPEAKER_00, And I wanted you to know that.,432.642,433.56
SPEAKER_00," Well, I appreciate you telling me that.",434.368,435.439
SPEAKER_00," Do you think it's possible that it's working the other way around, that the test is measuring  something that is actually there?",436.002,442.416
SPEAKER_01," No, I don't think so.",444.692,445.679
SPEAKER_00, You don't think so?,445.841,446.8
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,446.8,447.004
SPEAKER_00," So, you understand that result, that the 84 percentile, you understand what that means?",448.562,454.757
SPEAKER_00, Higher than we'd expect?,455.92,456.649
SPEAKER_01, I understand that I'm higher than 84—I'm higher than 84 percent of the population.,457.66,465.198
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,466.816,467.04
SPEAKER_01, But those people just think that's happening.,467.04,469.237
SPEAKER_01, And I know what is.,469.7,470.272
SPEAKER_00, Right.,470.741,470.864
SPEAKER_00, You believe their situation is different than yours?,471.68,472.68
SPEAKER_00, I do.,473.149,473.313
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,473.68,473.925
SPEAKER_00, I understand.,474.925,475.333
SPEAKER_00," So the last area, the last subscale I want to discuss—there's one global scale I want  to discuss—the last subscale is one that's referred to as psychoticism.",475.941,488.035
SPEAKER_00, And there you are at the 93rd percentile.,489.36,491.59
SPEAKER_00, And that's when maybe you can—you hear things other people don't hear or see things  other people don't see or have beliefs or thinking that are far outside the norm and  can't be supported by evidence.,493.96,509.2
SPEAKER_00, Do you ever feel like that's happening to you?,509.321,511.136
SPEAKER_01, Are you going to put me away?,511.822,513.03
SPEAKER_00, There's nothing here that would indicate that I'm going to put you away or send you anywhere.,514.881,518.556
SPEAKER_00," You know, I just really, the purpose of this is just to discuss the results, to make  sure you understand kind of how these inform our treatment of you.",519.6,527.839
SPEAKER_00," Like, so we're going to provide treatment to you in part based on these results.",528.341,531.47
SPEAKER_01, Sometimes I hear things other people don't hear.,534.56,536.519
SPEAKER_01, I know that.,536.762,537.211
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,538.069,538.273
SPEAKER_00," So this is a score that makes sense to you, where you think the test might be right.",538.64,542.533
SPEAKER_01, Maybe that's true.,544.6,545.273
SPEAKER_00, Maybe that's true.,545.6,546.029
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,546.702,546.927
SPEAKER_01, But I am being recorded.,547.6,548.212
SPEAKER_00, But you believe you're being recorded.,549.347,550.378
SPEAKER_00, You're certain of that.,550.6,551.166
SPEAKER_00, All right.,553.167,553.432
SPEAKER_00," So you understand those three scores, right, the phobic anxiety, the paranoid scale, subscale,  and the psychoticism subscale.",553.88,563.491
SPEAKER_00, I'd like to talk about one referred to as the global severity index.,564.68,569.857
SPEAKER_00," So this kind of takes all the different scores, all different items that you responded to,  and gives us a big picture of how you're doing.",570.72,580.153
SPEAKER_00," You know, how bad your symptoms are, how bothersome they are overall.",581.68,586.259
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,587.008,587.273
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,587.824,588.416
SPEAKER_01, Uh-huh.,588.661,588.886
SPEAKER_00," On this one, you were at the 68th percentile.",589.68,592.11
SPEAKER_00, Close to normal.,594.6,595.355
SPEAKER_00," Well, a little bit higher than we'd want to see.",596.844,598.548
SPEAKER_00," Not extremely far out, but it's 18 percentile higher than we'd want.",602.56,606.891
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,610.62,610.886
SPEAKER_00," Or than we'd normally see, rather.",613.506,614.633
SPEAKER_00, So it's a bit of a concern.,615.8,617.553
SPEAKER_00, Do you feel like overall you're dealing with symptoms okay?,618.5,621.415
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I don't like to go out much.",624.506,626.131
SPEAKER_01, And it really frustrates me when I see things or hear things other people don't.,628.96,632.459
SPEAKER_01, I promise you.,633.79,634.295
SPEAKER_01," But the other score is high, and it shouldn't be.",634.84,636.758
SPEAKER_01, So I might be closer to normal than you think.,637.0,639.397
SPEAKER_00," So with the paranoid, if that scale was accurate, then your estimation, your global severity  might be lower.",639.88,648.637
SPEAKER_01, I think so.,648.8,649.31
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,650.167,650.473
SPEAKER_00, Closer to that 50 percentile.,650.881,652.356
SPEAKER_01, I think so.,652.82,655.92
SPEAKER_00," So even if you were closer to the 50 percentile, you can understand how we're concerned that  your symptoms are somewhat severe.",655.92,665.375
SPEAKER_00, And we want to make sure we deliver treatment to address that.,666.28,669.276
SPEAKER_01, Sure.,670.572,670.797
SPEAKER_00, Is that okay?,670.98,671.491
SPEAKER_01, It is.,672.062,672.266
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,673.103,673.797
SPEAKER_00, So I will meet with the counselor that will be treating you here.,674.161,678.54
SPEAKER_00," And I'm going to go over these scores, and I'll explain to her what you've explained  to me.",679.002,683.785
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,684.642,684.887
SPEAKER_00, In terms of why you think you might have received each score.,685.802,688.579
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,689.149,689.332
SPEAKER_00, I'll go over that with her.,689.72,690.496
SPEAKER_00," And of course, you could discuss that with her too.",690.781,692.28
SPEAKER_00, And she'll have the results of this test in your chart.,692.34,696.539
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,697.106,697.392
SPEAKER_01," She's not going to record our session, is she?",698.062,700.317
SPEAKER_00, She's not going to be recording.,700.72,701.568
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,702.944,703.72
SPEAKER_00," Does that make sense, everything I've talked about here today?",703.76,705.976
SPEAKER_01, It does.,706.52,706.847
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,708.255,708.479
SPEAKER_00, I appreciate you allowing me to go over this set of results with you.,708.56,713.317
SPEAKER_00," And I'll get you assigned to that counselor, and we'll move forward with treatment.",714.24,719.179
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,719.663,719.949
SPEAKER_01, Thank you.,720.724,721.03
SPEAKER_00, Thank you.,721.52,721.728
