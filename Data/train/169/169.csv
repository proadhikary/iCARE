SPEAKER_00,14.678,15.459," Hi Jill, how you doing today?"
SPEAKER_01,16.501,17.129, I'm doing okay.
SPEAKER_00,18.0,18.385, Just okay?
SPEAKER_01,20.684,31.759," Well, I know we've talked before about me thinking about suicide and I'm starting to  think about it a little bit stronger than before, I think a little bit more clearly."
SPEAKER_00,33.004,36.359, Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
SPEAKER_01,37.042,47.337," Well, when we've talked before, I've had the feelings and the thoughts of suicide, but  now it's kind of starting to like, I'm thinking about it more often."
SPEAKER_01,48.2,52.274, I'm thinking about it a little more clearly and that's alarming to me.
SPEAKER_00,54.12,55.05, Do you want to die?
SPEAKER_01,56.262,57.39," Yeah, yeah, sometimes."
SPEAKER_00,58.841,59.494, Sometimes?
SPEAKER_01,60.02,77.559," I mean, you know, sometimes I know it would be scary to try it and my husband would be  so hurt, but at the same time, I want to end this."
SPEAKER_01,77.941,80.153, I want to end the feeling that I'm having.
SPEAKER_00,81.4,81.829, Depression?
SPEAKER_01,82.42,82.502, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,84.021,88.656, Do you have any plan as to how you would end your life if you decided to do that?
SPEAKER_01,90.1,96.567," I mean, I know if I wanted to that we have pills in the cabinet, so it wouldn't be that  hard."
SPEAKER_01,97.2,98.61, I could just take the bottle and...
SPEAKER_00,100.1,101.971, The same pills that you prescribed for the depression?
SPEAKER_01,103.741,103.986, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,105.142,107.133, Do you feel like you're going to carry out that plan?
SPEAKER_01,109.492,109.695, No.
SPEAKER_01,110.2,122.275," I mean, part of it, that's why I'm nervous because like I'm worried that I might, but  at the same time, you know, I'm afraid to."
SPEAKER_01,124.02,126.933, Sometimes I think that I might and sometimes I think I won't.
SPEAKER_01,128.7,131.535," I don't want to, but sometimes I get scared that I will."
SPEAKER_00,132.64,135.971, Today you're a little worried that you will or you're a little closer to it than usual.
SPEAKER_00,139.174,139.337, Right?
SPEAKER_00,142.2,144.095, We've talked about this before in the past.
SPEAKER_00,144.68,151.956," You've come in, you've had kind of that same plan with the pills and the thoughts."
SPEAKER_00,153.96,157.036, And what stopped you those times?
SPEAKER_00,157.76,158.563, What stopped you in the past?
SPEAKER_01,163.6,167.835," In the past, I thought, this will get better."
SPEAKER_01,169.481,170.851, I just have to keep trying.
SPEAKER_01,172.18,177.617," I thought, what will my husband feel when I'm gone?"
SPEAKER_01,178.48,182.59," And my family, my parents, my brother and sister."
SPEAKER_01,186.76,199.177," I thought that this is as bad as it can get and it has to get better eventually, but now  I'm just starting to feel like I don't think it's going to get better."
SPEAKER_00,201.905,210.533," All right, so those times before when you had the same feeling, right, you felt just  as bad as you feel now, really down, a little hopeless."
SPEAKER_00,212.72,218.498," What happened a few days after that, after the thoughts, suicide went away?"
SPEAKER_00,219.745,220.852, What was your outlook on life then?
SPEAKER_01,224.744,232.341," I mean, I feel a little better, you know, and then I'd say to myself, that was silly,  you know."
SPEAKER_01,235.581,236.43, I don't want to do that.
SPEAKER_01,237.461,239.334," I don't want to end things, you know."
SPEAKER_01,240.24,241.068, It's too rash.
SPEAKER_01,245.447,250.659," But, you know, it's starting to feel like a permanent problem."
SPEAKER_00,252.424,257.645," So you feel like this time, these suicidal thoughts, they're markedly different than  what you've experienced before?"
SPEAKER_01,261.48,265.179," I wouldn't say markedly, but I would say they're different."
SPEAKER_01,265.44,266.595," They're a little, they're stronger."
SPEAKER_00,266.96,267.808, More intense this time?
SPEAKER_01,268.98,269.348, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,270.001,270.94, All right.
SPEAKER_00,271.0,273.192, What do you think brought these feelings on?
SPEAKER_00,274.66,279.106," Before we talked about it, I know this relationship, surrounding relationships, they're the same  thing this time."
SPEAKER_01,285.0,287.9," I mean, I guess that has something to do with it."
SPEAKER_01,287.98,299.738," I guess it's just like when I look to everything, like everything that could be good or everything,  just everything like life, my relationships, the future."
SPEAKER_01,300.44,302.006, I just look at it and I see despair.
SPEAKER_01,305.92,311.179, I just see everything going wrong and I just don't see how it could get better.
SPEAKER_01,311.661,312.655, I just don't see it.
SPEAKER_00,313.345,314.398," You know, a sense of hopelessness."
SPEAKER_01,314.52,314.744, Yes.
SPEAKER_00,315.561,316.377, All right.
SPEAKER_00,316.58,322.96," So this time is different because you feel it's maybe less situational, less tied up  to relationships and more, well, philosophical."
SPEAKER_00,323.04,327.095, You're looking at your outlook and you're saying it's not going to get you better.
SPEAKER_00,328.58,329.386," That's the point, don't you know what?"
SPEAKER_00,333.723,334.091, All right.
SPEAKER_00,334.661,337.374, So this is a little bit of new territory for you.
SPEAKER_00,341.206,344.012, How long have you been feeling this way with the intensity you have right now?
SPEAKER_01,347.58,354.317," Probably a week, maybe, no less."
SPEAKER_00,355.6,358.217, What has prevented you from hurting yourself?
SPEAKER_00,358.721,359.408, That was last week.
SPEAKER_01,361.466,362.694, I'm afraid to do it.
SPEAKER_01,363.6,364.131, I'm just scared.
SPEAKER_01,364.781,369.198, It's like jumping off a diving board.
SPEAKER_01,369.6,372.632, Like you get up to the edge and you stand there.
SPEAKER_01,374.62,375.224, That's where I'm at.
SPEAKER_00,377.6,380.58, Have you made any gestures to harm yourself?
SPEAKER_00,380.66,387.62," Like if you went and grabbed the pills or went to the medicine cabinet and looked at  the pills, anything like that?"
SPEAKER_01,387.64,388.579, Yes.
SPEAKER_01,388.64,389.518, Sometimes I look at them.
SPEAKER_00,389.824,390.293, You look at them.
SPEAKER_00,391.044,392.357, Have you done anything further than look at them?
SPEAKER_01,392.942,395.539," Well, I mean, so I have to take them."
SPEAKER_01,395.64,396.538, It's my prescription.
SPEAKER_01,396.921,407.519," So when it's time I start thinking about it, like it's more, I think about my, like the  ideations come even more because it's like a trigger."
SPEAKER_01,407.7,408.68, It's like I'm thinking about the pills.
SPEAKER_01,408.861,423.076," So I go to the cabinet and I get my pills and I take the one that I'm supposed to, but  I just look at the bottle and I kind of stand there and I just think instead of putting  the bottle back, I could take it with me."
SPEAKER_00,424.443,425.166, And what do you end up doing?
SPEAKER_01,428.821,430.489," It takes a while, but I put it back."
SPEAKER_01,433.272,433.68, It's scary.
SPEAKER_01,434.102,438.72," Like I look into the bottle and I'm afraid because dying is scary, but."
SPEAKER_00,443.022,446.66, And how about the pain that you would cause your husband and the rest of your family?
SPEAKER_01,448.411,449.378," Yeah, I don't want to do that."
SPEAKER_00,449.802,450.72, You don't want that?
SPEAKER_01,451.202,455.72," I don't, I don't, I don't want my husband to find me."
SPEAKER_01,455.74,458.72, I don't want him to feel like this is his fault.
SPEAKER_01,458.78,462.418, I don't want him to be sad that I'm gone.
SPEAKER_01,464.489,466.298, I don't want him to feel like I feel.
SPEAKER_00,468.582,477.74," And when relatives of somebody that committed suicide hear about the suicide, who do they blame?"
SPEAKER_00,477.76,478.025, The suicide.
SPEAKER_01,478.821,479.25, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,480.79,481.76, And it's not their fault.
SPEAKER_01,483.174,483.76, It's not their fault.
SPEAKER_01,483.8,488.8, And I know that they wouldn't be able to get over it.
SPEAKER_01,488.8,491.827, And I know that they'll be thinking about how bad I felt.
SPEAKER_01,499.748,502.74, They'll have to know what it really felt like for me.
SPEAKER_01,505.8,507.8," So I know this is a tough time, right?"
SPEAKER_00,509.35,510.78, But the good news is you're here talking to me about it.
SPEAKER_00,510.84,511.697, Right?
SPEAKER_00,511.84,516.404," And you're talking about it, I'm going to guess that you want to do something for  bad to feel better."
SPEAKER_00,518.9,521.598, Are you going to carry out your plan?
SPEAKER_00,522.021,525.297, Are you going to hurt yourself?
SPEAKER_01,526.162,526.927, I don't want to.
SPEAKER_00,531.332,531.734, Are you going to?
SPEAKER_01,532.84,532.881, No.
SPEAKER_01,534.944,547.921," I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think,  I think if I can just remember what it'll be like for them that will keep me from doing  it."
SPEAKER_01,548.88,555.396," You know it's the times that I forget to think about how they're going to feel, that I get  closer to the edge."
SPEAKER_01,555.6,564.3," But when I remember, you know, like it upsets me to think about what it'll be like for them."
SPEAKER_01,564.48,570.5," So if I can remember to think about that, then it'll help me not do that."
SPEAKER_01,570.64,578.824, But I think having the pills there in the cabinet like that is a big temptation for  me.
SPEAKER_00,580.151,580.437, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,580.6,581.97, So can we do this?
SPEAKER_00,583.36,585.633," Your husband's at home, as I mentioned."
SPEAKER_00,586.82,588.332, You take the pills once a day?
SPEAKER_00,589.46,590.093, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,590.522,590.746, Right.
SPEAKER_01,591.46,592.44, Before bed?
SPEAKER_01,592.624,592.889, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,595.644,603.84," Can we, would you be willing to sign a release so I can talk to him and he can hold onto  those pills and just give you the pill each night?"
SPEAKER_00,603.92,604.879, You take one a night?
SPEAKER_01,604.92,605.165, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,605.92,606.675, Would that be okay?
SPEAKER_01,607.423,609.435," Yeah, I think that would be a good idea."
SPEAKER_00,610.36,614.162, Is there anything else in the medicine cabinet or anywhere else in the house that could be  of danger to you?
SPEAKER_01,619.561,626.174," I think, yeah, I think it would be a good idea to just make sure that everything that  was in the medicine cabinet."
SPEAKER_00,626.76,627.719, All the pills?
SPEAKER_01,627.944,628.046, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,629.025,629.27, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,629.76,630.74, Would he be willing to do that?
SPEAKER_01,630.76,633.119," Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that he would be willing to do that."
SPEAKER_01,633.2,637.798," He doesn't, he wants me to get through this."
SPEAKER_00,638.71,638.955, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,639.281,642.138," And if I get a release to talk, I might go sign it?"
SPEAKER_01,642.4,643.592," Yeah, I'll do that."
SPEAKER_00,645.176,645.38, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,645.4,650.38," I was really before, or you're familiar rather with this concept that we talked about before,  contracting for safety."
SPEAKER_00,651.003,654.139, I remember the prior times when you've been in the state.
SPEAKER_00,654.24,654.767, Similar to this.
SPEAKER_00,655.72,660.135, Can you promise me that you're going to not harm yourself?
SPEAKER_01,661.721,663.317," I can, yeah, I can do that."
SPEAKER_01,663.982,666.194," At least until next week when we meet again, I promise."
SPEAKER_00,667.36,668.278, Let's be a little searing that.
SPEAKER_01,668.462,668.789, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,669.421,669.605, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,670.462,671.36, Set something up for Ammar.
SPEAKER_00,671.462,671.646, Okay.
SPEAKER_01,672.36,673.36," Yeah, I can definitely do that."
SPEAKER_00,673.38,673.911, I can do that.
SPEAKER_00,674.931,675.156, All right.
SPEAKER_00,676.422,676.891, This is a rough time.
SPEAKER_00,677.824,679.777, I'm trying to appreciate how rough it is for you.
SPEAKER_00,680.562,690.328," I want you to keep in mind how you felt after the times before and how you do tend to pull  out of this and you look back at it a lot differently, but in the moment it's hard to  see that."
SPEAKER_00,691.963,702.054," It doesn't necessarily make this any easier, but if you can hang on until we can get through  this cycle of depression, you'll probably have a different outlook."
SPEAKER_00,704.762,706.999," If history is any evidence, right?"
SPEAKER_01,707.323,707.487, Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,708.242,708.854, Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00,709.2,710.13, Does that kind of make sense?
SPEAKER_00,711.915,712.16, All right.
SPEAKER_00,712.421,715.954," So, what do you have planned for the rest of the day after you leave here?"
SPEAKER_01,717.68,718.898," You know, I'm just going to go home."
SPEAKER_01,719.06,722.195," My husband will be home from work and have dinner, watch TV."
SPEAKER_01,724.091,724.699," He'll be there, so."
SPEAKER_00,724.921,730.344, Are you going to be alone at any time between when you leave here and when you come and  see me tomorrow?
SPEAKER_01,733.91,735.42," Um, yeah."
SPEAKER_01,735.54,742.514," I'll probably be home for a little while in the morning, but I have to work so I won't  have, you know, I'll be busy."
SPEAKER_00,744.13,744.679, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,744.72,750.377," If these feelings intensify to where you do feel you're going to act on them, would you  promise to call me?"
SPEAKER_00,750.682,752.015," If you can't get along with me, call 911?"
SPEAKER_01,753.429,754.257," Yeah, I'll do that."
SPEAKER_00,754.622,754.826, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,755.962,762.377, I'm going to go get that released so we can talk to your husband and then I'll see you  for a few minutes and we'll set up a plan for tomorrow.
SPEAKER_01,763.251,763.393, Okay.
SPEAKER_00,763.985,764.373, All right?
SPEAKER_00,764.883,765.679, Thank you.
SPEAKER_01,765.72,766.22," Thanks, Joe."
