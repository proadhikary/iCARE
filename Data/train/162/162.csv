SPEAKER_00, How are you doing today?,0.0,0.461
SPEAKER_01, I'm okay.,7.0,7.163
SPEAKER_00, What's been going on?,8.0,8.404
SPEAKER_01," Well, last time I started to tell you a little bit about one of my friends, my best friend",15.227,20.293
SPEAKER_01," actually, she had this issue.",26.0,26.927
SPEAKER_01, So what happened was she went to a bathroom at our local library and she found a video  camera when she was going to the bathroom.,29.001,39.599
SPEAKER_00, In the bathroom?,39.76,40.229
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, she actually, yeah.",40.76,41.952
SPEAKER_01," And she turned it into the police and I guess because she carried it or she had found it,  her handprints were on it and they weren't able to detect who actually did it.",43.121,53.913
SPEAKER_01, They weren't able to catch the person.,55.76,56.76
SPEAKER_00," Oh, they didn't catch the person?",56.76,57.699
SPEAKER_01, No.,57.903,58.127
SPEAKER_01, So since then I've been on really just high alert.,59.483,63.318
SPEAKER_01," I'm worried that that could happen to me, to my kids.",63.8,66.458
SPEAKER_01, I'm just really worried because they didn't catch the guy that him or someone like him  could be out there.,68.024,73.617
SPEAKER_00, So he's still out in the community.,73.76,74.867
SPEAKER_01, Right.,77.331,77.474
SPEAKER_00, So how is it affecting your daily life?,77.921,80.277
SPEAKER_00, Can you tell me kind of what you've been feeling?,80.88,84.455
SPEAKER_01," A lot of anxiety, just not knowing maybe what if someone were to videotape me like  that.",86.121,93.903
SPEAKER_01," I've been very aware, shall I say, of cameras.",94.76,98.354
SPEAKER_00," Okay, so anxious and aware.",99.962,101.174
SPEAKER_01," Right, like I know you have one in your office and people on their cell phone cameras.",102.261,108.677
SPEAKER_00, Others?,110.25,110.576
SPEAKER_01, Just all the possibilities that I could be recorded.,111.866,114.539
SPEAKER_01," I've just been very aware of them, which makes me not want to go anywhere.",114.76,117.775
SPEAKER_01, So I've been having arguments with my husband a lot because he wants to go out to restaurants  and I don't want to go because there could be cameras in the bathrooms.,118.86,127.154
SPEAKER_01," And how I dress also, as you can see, I'm kind of dressed more conservatively because  I remember hearing once about cameras that people use on shoes that could be used in  a creepy way.",128.84,142.76
SPEAKER_01," And so I can't, you know, it's now almost summertime, I can't dress in skirts or be  comfortable because I'm dressing like that.",143.342,150.74
SPEAKER_00," Right, so you covered a lot of ground there.",150.881,152.76
SPEAKER_00," So you have the feeling of being worried, nervous, that it's going to happen to you.",153.061,160.038
SPEAKER_00, But you've also had to kind of change your routine or you have to change your routine  to feel safer.,160.901,165.699
SPEAKER_01, Right.,166.331,166.474
SPEAKER_00, Has that helped?,166.903,167.617
SPEAKER_00," Has changing the way you dress or changing where you go and when you go, has that helped  reduce the anxiety?",167.88,174.106
SPEAKER_01, Not really.,176.362,176.791
SPEAKER_00, No?,177.484,177.525
SPEAKER_01," I would say it's really, that's why I wanted to come in.",178.26,179.679
SPEAKER_01, It's really starting to affect my life.,179.76,181.515
SPEAKER_00, You mentioned specifically your husband.,182.08,183.558
SPEAKER_00, Like what's been going on there?,184.467,185.356
SPEAKER_01, Right.,186.372,186.515
SPEAKER_01," He just wants to go places with our kids, like go out to eat and I don't really want  to go anywhere because, you know, cameras are everywhere nowadays.",186.76,193.74
SPEAKER_00, They are?,193.862,194.331
SPEAKER_01," And I just kind of worry like public bathrooms, could they be there?",195.001,198.897
SPEAKER_01," Could someone be, you know, sometimes baby monitors are hooked to phones and people can  hack into that.",199.8,205.891
SPEAKER_01, Laptop cameras.,207.305,208.295
SPEAKER_01," So even in my own house, I've just been really nervous.",208.961,211.7
SPEAKER_01, So I feel like I'm not really getting relief from that anxiety.,211.941,214.896
SPEAKER_00, Have you taken any precautions because of this persistent worry?,216.161,220.576
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I've read...",221.842,222.638
SPEAKER_00, Other than what you already mentioned.,222.76,223.74
SPEAKER_00," With the camera specifically, I mean.",223.76,225.028
SPEAKER_01," I've, you know, when I go into bathrooms, I've been looking for cameras to make sure  they weren't there before.",226.84,232.597
SPEAKER_01," You know, me and my children have used the bathroom.",232.921,235.089
SPEAKER_01," I have tried, I've read online that you can turn, how to turn off the cameras on your  phone and that you can close your laptop and that way the camera will face down.",238.242,247.117
SPEAKER_01," So, and the same thing on a smart TV, so it doesn't recognize your face.",248.242,251.74
SPEAKER_01, I've tried to turn things off that don't need to be on as far as people being able  to access my own information.,252.282,258.598
SPEAKER_00, And that seems reasonable.,258.78,260.275
SPEAKER_00, So you've taken reasonable precautions to try to avoid being video recorded against,260.9,266.599
SPEAKER_00, your will.,266.76,267.719
SPEAKER_01, Exactly.,267.801,268.025
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,269.413,269.719
SPEAKER_00," But still you have this feeling of worry, anxiety and your schedule is being interfered  with.",269.76,274.903
SPEAKER_01, Right.,275.76,275.944
SPEAKER_00," So you'd like to cope more effectively with your feelings, reduce this anxiety.",277.82,284.038
SPEAKER_01, Right.,284.78,285.515
SPEAKER_00," So, when you enter into a public bathroom, and we talked about automatic thoughts before.",286.001,292.68
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,293.209,293.495
SPEAKER_01, Those thoughts just kind of pop into our head and they connect to feelings that can be unpleasant.,294.281,301.76
SPEAKER_00, Right.,302.229,302.393
SPEAKER_00, Like anxiety and worry.,302.821,303.556
SPEAKER_00," So, when you walk into a public restroom, what's the first thing that goes through your  mind?",304.543,309.903
SPEAKER_01," That there might be a video camera that I don't see, that's maybe like with my friend  it was big enough, but I might not catch it and that someone's going to use that in a  vulnerable way.",312.024,323.114
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,324.168,324.311
SPEAKER_00," So, when you walk in, you're wondering if there's a camera there.",324.901,327.76
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,327.903,328.046
SPEAKER_00," And when that automatic thought occurs, what follows that in terms of a feeling or a behavior?",328.82,334.737
SPEAKER_01," Usually, I'll try and find the camera, but it's usually anxiety, fear, my heart rate  starts going up, I start getting really anxious.",336.222,343.76
SPEAKER_01," And then, you know, I try and either rush to use the bathroom if I really have to go,  or a lot of times if I don't, I'll just leave.",344.021,350.659
SPEAKER_01, Sometimes I try and use the bathroom at home so I don't have to go out.,351.223,353.72
SPEAKER_00, All right.,354.331,354.597
SPEAKER_00," So, your behavior is looking for the camera or sometimes just leaving without using the  restroom.",354.76,357.964
SPEAKER_01, Right.,358.78,359.536
SPEAKER_00, And your feeling is that anxiety worry that we've been talking about.,359.76,363.676
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,365.229,365.331
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,366.27,366.536
SPEAKER_00," So, really if we think about, we talked before about core beliefs, intermediate beliefs,  and I'm wondering if the intermediate belief isn't I'm vulnerable or this, you know, more  specifically maybe, and that's more of a core belief, more specifically I'm vulnerable in  this area, like with this guy on the loose that, you know, committed that crime.",367.643,394.557
SPEAKER_00," And then, you know, that's combining with situations that you encounter and that's where  you're getting those automatic thoughts.",396.001,400.76
SPEAKER_00, Does that sort of make sense?,400.942,402.598
SPEAKER_01, Exactly.,403.127,403.597
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,403.882,404.189
SPEAKER_00," So, you remember what, in terms of cognitive therapy, you like to apply what we call the  adaptive response or self-talk.",404.861,411.156
SPEAKER_01, Right.,412.148,412.352
SPEAKER_00," So, it's that thought that you interject at that moment you realize you're having an  automatic thought that's going to lead to, in this case, anxiety and worry and behaviors  that, well, looking for the camera isn't maybe an unuseful behavior, but leaving, you know,  that could certainly be an unuseful behavior.",412.941,431.599
SPEAKER_00," So, in terms of that self-talk, let's work to develop a self-talk response.",433.444,440.058
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,440.821,440.964
SPEAKER_00," So, there's something you could tell yourself to that initial, you know, I wonder if there's  a camera in this bathroom.",441.76,449.154
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,450.189,450.495
SPEAKER_00, All right.,451.474,451.76
SPEAKER_00, What do you think you could tell yourself that would get in between that thought and  the feelings you're having?,452.422,458.787
SPEAKER_01, I could say if when I walk in the bathroom.,461.324,463.76
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,463.78,463.984
SPEAKER_01," Maybe I could say, you know, while there could be a chance that there's a camera in this  bathroom, the chance of it happening is not very likely.",465.221,477.7
SPEAKER_01," And, you know, I'm going to take steps to keep myself safe so that I won't be in a vulnerable  position, such as looking for the cameras.",479.303,489.015
SPEAKER_00, Right.,490.556,490.74
SPEAKER_00, That's good.,490.78,491.413
SPEAKER_00," So, you have a low probability of it happening, and you're taking useful behaviors to minimize  your risk even further.",492.221,499.699
SPEAKER_00, Right.,500.066,500.25
SPEAKER_01, Right.,500.78,501.025
SPEAKER_00," So, that's a good automatic thought.",502.222,503.509
SPEAKER_00," I think, or a good adaptive response for the automatic thought, rather.",505.9,509.914
SPEAKER_00," Why don't you try that one out, right, the next time you have that automatic thought?",511.84,517.68
SPEAKER_01, Right.,518.413,518.597
SPEAKER_00, Try out that.,518.78,519.107
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,519.78,519.903
SPEAKER_00," And, you know, that's logical.",520.76,521.719
SPEAKER_00," I mean, it's unlikely to happen.",521.78,522.827
SPEAKER_00," Of course, there's a chance, right?",525.467,526.74
SPEAKER_01, Right.,526.984,527.127
SPEAKER_00, And we acknowledge that in the self-talk.,527.76,528.76
SPEAKER_00," There's a chance that it could happen, but there's precautions you can take that's a  low chance.",529.142,533.689
SPEAKER_01, Right.,534.842,535.087
SPEAKER_00," Sometimes, as well, so keep that automatic thought kind of, you know, we'll review it  at the end.",535.82,540.433
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,540.76,540.862
SPEAKER_00," Right, before you leave today.",541.76,542.992
SPEAKER_00, We'll write these down.,543.944,544.678
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,545.168,545.536
SPEAKER_00," But that's one adaptive response, rather, that I want to write down for you.",545.76,549.358
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,550.393,550.76
SPEAKER_00," I also want to talk about, like, the worst case scenario, because right now you have  the anxiety and the worry about an event that, while it's unlikely it could happen, it could  happen.",550.82,560.984
SPEAKER_01, Right.,562.046,562.25
SPEAKER_00," And I'm wondering how you think you would react if the worst did happen, if you used  the restroom and you found out from law enforcement or by finding a camera that an offender had  been, you know, watching you, right, on a recording.",562.78,582.037
SPEAKER_00, I think you would react to that.,583.144,584.033
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I think I would be really upset.",585.404,587.76
SPEAKER_01, I think I would feel vulnerable probably for a while and be hesitant.,588.502,593.479
SPEAKER_01," But, I mean, I think ultimately I would be okay.",593.76,597.836
SPEAKER_01," My friend, this happened a while ago, she's starting to get over it and get back to her  usual routine, although she's still hesitant.",599.403,606.72
SPEAKER_01," So I think I would be okay eventually, although I'd be really upset that it happened.",606.921,611.459
SPEAKER_00," And it would make sense to feel upset, right?",611.861,613.679
SPEAKER_00, That would be upsetting for anybody.,614.124,615.558
SPEAKER_01, Right.,616.005,616.107
SPEAKER_00," But, as you noted, that would probably be relatively temporary.",617.162,620.76
SPEAKER_01, Right.,620.882,621.168
SPEAKER_00," Distressed, right?",621.882,622.597
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,622.76,623.148
SPEAKER_00," While acute, and certainly, you know, you wouldn't be happy about it and shouldn't be  happy about it.",623.82,627.76
SPEAKER_01, Right.,627.76,628.005
SPEAKER_00, It would probably go away.,628.964,629.719
SPEAKER_00, You'd probably learn to adapt.,629.78,630.811
SPEAKER_00, How long have you been in this state of anxiety and worry?,632.102,635.418
SPEAKER_01, Probably it happened like two months ago.,637.023,638.76
SPEAKER_00, Two months.,638.821,639.678
SPEAKER_00, And how many days in the average week are you affected by these feelings?,640.78,645.76
SPEAKER_01, Usually every day.,645.842,646.699
SPEAKER_00, Every day.,646.964,647.413
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,648.066,648.372
SPEAKER_00," So if we can compare it, right, we have the chances of being recorded, right, illegally.",648.76,653.7
SPEAKER_00, That's a low probability event.,654.063,655.437
SPEAKER_00," It could happen, probably not likely.",655.76,657.679
SPEAKER_00," The anxiety and the worry that you're having, that's a high probability event because you're  suffering from it every day.",658.383,662.76
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's true.",662.76,663.76
SPEAKER_01, I never thought about it that way.,664.76,666.72
SPEAKER_00," So there's a point at which maybe you reach and you say, I'd rather take the risk, I'd  rather deal with the potential consequence of an unlikely event of being recorded and  face that if it happens than be in the state of anxiety and worry.",667.041,686.76
SPEAKER_01, Right.,687.291,687.454
SPEAKER_01, Because right now I'm suffering every day.,687.76,689.275
SPEAKER_00," Right, now you're suffering, right.",689.78,691.295
SPEAKER_01, Right.,692.189,692.331
SPEAKER_00," So if you could adaptively respond effectively, you're still going to have that risk of being  recorded, but you know you could survive that event if it happened.",692.78,702.659
SPEAKER_01," Right, yeah, I think I could.",703.164,704.235
SPEAKER_00, And you're taking reasonable cautions and all the things we talked about.,704.76,707.453
SPEAKER_00," So as you think about this in a more general sense, is there an adaptive response you could  apply to that on-the-act thought of I need to be worried about this or whatever that  thought looks like.",708.78,722.25
SPEAKER_00," Sometimes the thought's an image, right, so maybe an image of being recorded.",722.981,725.72
SPEAKER_00," But whatever that kind of general series of automatic thoughts are that are getting you  anxious and worried before you even get out of the house, what adaptive response could  you apply there?",726.121,735.148
SPEAKER_01," Maybe, you know, like I said, I'm worried about all the cameras.",737.107,739.74
SPEAKER_01," Maybe I could say, you know, I understand there's some cameras that, you know, are used  for good purposes like security.",740.041,748.72
SPEAKER_00, Probably most are.,748.944,749.617
SPEAKER_01, Right.,749.842,750.066
SPEAKER_01, And the chances of being recorded illegally are not likely.,751.482,757.018
SPEAKER_01," And I'm taking precautions to, you know, go to the right places, the good areas.",757.84,763.817
SPEAKER_01, So it's not likely to happen overall.,765.384,767.297
SPEAKER_01," And me going outside the house is worth the risk, you know, the minimal risk that it would  happen.",767.76,776.046
SPEAKER_01," And if it did happen, I could survive.",776.78,778.619
SPEAKER_00, That's good.,778.923,779.617
SPEAKER_00,That’s a good adaptive response.,780.182,783.639
SPEAKER_00, And that's kind of a few adaptive responses.,,
SPEAKER_00, But that's good.,784.862,785.433
SPEAKER_00, And you can apply them and we'll kind of break them down.,785.901,788.659
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,788.984,789.189
SPEAKER_00," Like I said before you leave today, we'll break those down.",789.76,791.512
SPEAKER_00, So you can hammer them down as you go out.,793.324,795.76
SPEAKER_00," And I think it's important because, you know, automatic thoughts tend to spring on us quickly.",795.82,801.238
SPEAKER_00, It's important to rehearse these adaptive responses so we're ready to go.,801.841,804.7
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,805.209,805.474
SPEAKER_00, Right.,805.842,806.005
SPEAKER_00," And kind of, you know, we're being, we're preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive  response.",806.78,812.066
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,812.801,813.107
SPEAKER_00," And in order to be prepared, you have to know what it is.",813.76,815.538
SPEAKER_00, So it's good to have it written down and kind of more or less commit to memory.,816.102,819.76
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,820.229,820.433
SPEAKER_00, Does that kind of make sense?,820.901,821.689
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,823.515,823.638
SPEAKER_00, All right.,823.944,824.658
SPEAKER_00," So before you leave today, I'll take care of that.",824.76,827.514
SPEAKER_00, And I want you to use those adaptive responses for this week.,828.82,833.619
SPEAKER_00, I'll see you next week.,834.447,835.154
SPEAKER_00, And record what the outcome was every time you're able to apply that response.,836.241,842.7
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,842.842,842.984
SPEAKER_00, And that includes what you felt and what you actually did.,844.001,848.479
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,848.78,848.923
SPEAKER_00, Right.,849.984,850.25
SPEAKER_00," And of course as you mentioned any, you know, physiological reactions like your heart racing  or anything like that.",851.182,855.74
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,855.76,855.903
SPEAKER_00," So that's, really that's a behavior.",856.881,858.679
SPEAKER_00, But note both physiological behaviors and other behaviors.,859.182,863.76
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,863.78,863.944
SPEAKER_00," You know, once you're consciously controlling and then any feelings.",864.84,868.619
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,869.127,869.352
SPEAKER_00," And we'll go through them, we'll go through each time you use it, one by one behavior  there are.",869.86,875.74
SPEAKER_00, And kind of see if we need to adjust the adaptive response and see how well it's working.,875.76,879.298
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,880.127,880.331
SPEAKER_00, Does that sound like the plan?,880.801,881.699
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I think that would be really helpful.",881.76,883.215
SPEAKER_00, All right.,884.311,884.76
SPEAKER_00, So we'll go from there and I appreciate you coming in today.,884.76,886.76
SPEAKER_01, Thank you very much.,886.944,887.597
SPEAKER_00," Thanks, guys.",887.842,888.495
SPEAKER_00, Bye.,889.025,889.319
