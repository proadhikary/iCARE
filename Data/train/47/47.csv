SPEAKER_00," Hello Carl, how you doing today?",0.0,0.602
SPEAKER_01," I'm good, how are you?",15.094,16.497
SPEAKER_00," I'm doing well, thanks for asking.",18.36,19.528
SPEAKER_00, Last week you were talking in therapy.,21.44,24.339
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I mean, and I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week,  but Jill, I was telling you about Jill, my coworker, and she was kind of bothering me  the past couple of weeks, but really this past week was like the worst, right?",24.902,39.897
SPEAKER_01," So she's not doing her paperwork, and the thing is that she has to do these reports  in order for me to do my reports.",40.6,47.935
SPEAKER_01," So if she doesn't have hers, I can't do mine, and then I can't get mine out in time for  the next person to do theirs, and it's a mess, the whole thing's a mess.",48.56,55.733
SPEAKER_01, And it's annoying me.,57.822,58.668
SPEAKER_00," So her work slow down, or not being efficient work, is affecting your work productivity.",60.4,68.4
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, it definitely is.",68.682,70.034
SPEAKER_01," And it's one of those things that like, you know, it gives me a bad evaluation.",70.82,80.098
SPEAKER_01," If I'm not handing my stuff in in time, then it reflects negatively on me, you know, and  it's all kind of, she's the first level, you know, and then all the other levels are  kind of dependent on her turning things in on time.",81.1,95.938
SPEAKER_01," So if she doesn't, then I don't, then the next person does, and so forth.",96.28,99.698
SPEAKER_00, And it makes it seem like you're not doing your job.,100.0,102.278
SPEAKER_01," Right, yeah, and my boss doesn't like it, my boss's boss doesn't like it, and so forth,  you know?",102.52,107.984
SPEAKER_01," And I try to explain to them, you know, she's the problem, but it doesn't always, I don't  always have the time to go up and tell them, like, here's what's happening, or it just  somehow doesn't come out.",108.8,120.286
SPEAKER_00, You don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about  the situation.,122.28,127.809
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, and that's pretty annoying too, because, you know, it's one thing if people get mad  at me, but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job like I'm supposed to.",129.142,139.737
SPEAKER_01," But it's another thing for them to get mad at me not realizing it's not my fault, you  know?",140.52,145.262
SPEAKER_00, You have an explanation for why the work's not getting done.,146.2,148.419
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I do, I do, that's the thing.",148.6,150.595
SPEAKER_01," But I can't always get it out, you know, I can't always tell the person that has the  complaint about it.",151.24,156.95
SPEAKER_01," And yeah, I mean, I've tried talking to my boss, and I've tried talking to other people  too, you know, but it really hasn't gotten anywhere.",157.72,168.556
SPEAKER_00, So you're feeling stuck with this whole thing.,171.789,173.878
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah I am, and I mean, I talked to Jill a little bit about it too, you know, and I  tried to ask, I tried kind of genuinely reminding her, you know, like, such and such needs to  be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock.",174.5,192.376
SPEAKER_01," I didn't want to be real abrasive, you know, but I tried to remind her.",193.661,197.317
SPEAKER_00, It was a polite approach.,198.0,198.837
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, and it didn't really seem to work because it still happened, you know.",199.8,206.775
SPEAKER_00, Your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you want it.,209.24,212.578
SPEAKER_01," No, no it really hasn't, and that's just, I feel like I've tried everything that I could  try, you know?",213.12,220.98
SPEAKER_01," And even like, I came home and I was talking to a friend about it, and I was trying to  think of other solutions, right?",221.0,229.579
SPEAKER_01," You know, I was trying to think like, what else I could do, what else I could say, who  else I could talk to, things like that, you know?",230.042,236.814
SPEAKER_01," And I mean, my friend, you know, he was listening and stuff, and had some good suggestions,  but he didn't know what to do either, like, because he doesn't know the way the company  works, you know?",238.101,248.037
SPEAKER_01," So like, I got nothing.",248.46,250.859
SPEAKER_00, You're not getting the help you need for this.,251.806,253.156
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, not at all.",253.861,255.174
SPEAKER_01," I'm feeling pretty lost with it, and I wish it was just like a clear way to do things,  like, this is what you should do now.",256.2,264.67
SPEAKER_01, And I don't see anything.,266.08,267.034
SPEAKER_00, Some sort of clear plan.,267.48,268.351
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah.",269.221,270.13
SPEAKER_01," But yeah, I don't see a way to go about it.",271.34,275.079
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I've, so I've, okay, so this is the way I laid it out in my mind.",275.24,278.82
SPEAKER_01, I tried talking to the people above me.,278.94,280.949
SPEAKER_01, Didn't work out the way I thought it would.,283.28,284.776
SPEAKER_01," I tried talking to the people below me, so to speak, just lower on the, before me in  the process.",285.16,292.733
SPEAKER_01, That's what I mean.,293.08,293.57
SPEAKER_01," And that didn't work out, which is just Jill, and I talked to her, and that didn't work.",294.381,297.87
SPEAKER_01," So like, there's nowhere else I could turn.",301.64,304.092
SPEAKER_00, The options are exhausted.,305.68,306.837
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, that's what it seems like to me.",307.642,308.926
SPEAKER_00, And this is frustrating for you.,313.601,314.796
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it is.",315.141,315.958
SPEAKER_01," And I've been trying to rack my brain, you know, like, what else could I do?",316.802,320.515
SPEAKER_01, You know?,321.92,322.124
SPEAKER_01," Like, maybe if I could, maybe if there was like a committee or something that I could  go to, you know, I'd be like, well, this person's not doing what they're supposed to be doing.",322.92,334.159
SPEAKER_01," But there's not, there's no committee like that.",334.32,335.547
SPEAKER_01," Or even if there was like a person, you know, like a resolution person or whatever, but  there's nobody like that.",337.6,344.632
SPEAKER_00, There's no other avenue.,345.4,346.196
SPEAKER_01, That's what it seems like to me.,347.065,348.194
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,348.9,349.084
SPEAKER_01," And that's, I mean, that's, and you know, as I'm even trying to think, like, I don't  know, should I write a letter to somebody maybe?",350.1,361.554
SPEAKER_01, But I don't even know who or what.,362.8,364.728
SPEAKER_00," You thought about a letter, but who would you send it to?",367.92,371.398
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,371.72,371.842
SPEAKER_01," Or like, just something else that I can do instead of going to this person, going to  that person, that didn't work.",375.706,381.809
SPEAKER_01, Could I call somebody?,384.147,386.299
SPEAKER_01," Is there anybody else in the company that, you know, might handle stuff like that?",386.4,391.558
SPEAKER_01," But I mean, there's HR people, but that's, I can't really see where they could come in.",392.04,397.973
SPEAKER_01, I don't know how human resources could deal with something like that.,401.52,404.755
SPEAKER_00, You don't feel them as a potential solution?,405.88,407.594
SPEAKER_01, No.,408.829,408.87
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, no, I don't.",410.566,411.229
SPEAKER_01," I wonder maybe if there's like a, but there's, I mean, I'm thinking now that there's gotta  be something or somebody or somewhere that I could put in like, almost like a complaint  or something, like something's out of my hands and I don't know what to do about it.",418.188,444.14
SPEAKER_01," Like, there's gotta be something.",444.321,445.231
SPEAKER_01," And now that I'm saying this, I'm thinking that there's gotta be.",446.1,449.094
SPEAKER_00, Some other resource you haven't tried yet.,450.5,451.975
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah.",452.562,452.847
SPEAKER_01," And I mean, now I'm trying to think back to my training, you know, initially.",453.62,458.938
SPEAKER_01," You know, maybe there's, you know what, I think now that I'm thinking a little bit harder  about it, a little bit differently about it, I'm thinking that there's like a, man, I forget  what they call it now, but maybe like a complaint.",464.449,479.132
SPEAKER_01," It's not the right word, but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something.",480.32,485.497
SPEAKER_01," And I think, if I remember correctly, those suggestions and those complaints get brought  up at every staff meeting, which we have like every other week.",486.58,494.807
SPEAKER_00, They're discussed at this regular meeting.,500.16,501.997
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,502.38,503.197
SPEAKER_01," And I'm thinking now, I mean, nobody really uses it, but I'm thinking like maybe that's  an avenue that I can use, you know, like maybe that'll get brought up and maybe that's something  that might actually work.",503.963,516.213
SPEAKER_00, This could be another option for you.,517.36,518.556
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, it could be.",518.88,519.791
SPEAKER_01," And then if it does work, it'll get brought, rather if they do read it, it'll get brought  up at the staff meeting where everybody's at.",520.64,528.059
SPEAKER_01," My boss, my boss's boss, Jill, everybody's there.",528.2,530.874
SPEAKER_01, And maybe that's a way for it to come to everybody's attention that deadlines being missed affect  other people in ways that you don't really know about.,532.22,546.009
SPEAKER_00, So everyone will hear your complaint and maybe react in a way that would help you.,548.4,554.24
SPEAKER_01," Maybe, yeah.",554.26,554.849
SPEAKER_01," I think that's, I mean, that's gotta be the way to do it.",555.64,557.956
SPEAKER_01, And maybe that's the best way.,558.52,559.511
SPEAKER_01," I really think, yeah, I mean, after saying all that and after going through that, I really  think that that's probably the best way to do it.",560.601,567.031
SPEAKER_01," And if it doesn't, then I guess I can find another way, but I really think that's the best way to do it.",569.081,572.635
SPEAKER_00, You feel as though you've found an option here.,573.96,575.535
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, I do.",576.08,577.834
SPEAKER_01," And even if that doesn't work, then it'll be brought up and maybe it'll allow me to  talk to my boss further about it and maybe they'll understand really where I'm coming from.",578.6,590.097
SPEAKER_01," But this will at least be a start to something, you know, to make me a lot less stressed with  deadlines and stuff, you know.",590.84,599.64
SPEAKER_00, You are frustrated with all this.,599.64,600.713
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,601.79,602.158
SPEAKER_01," But maybe, maybe after I do that, you know, put in the complaint or suggestion, maybe  I won't be as frustrated.",602.3,610.22
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I'm feeling a little bit less frustrated now, even thinking that there is another option, you know.",611.461,616.996
SPEAKER_00, It feels better now as you're contemplating another potential avenue here.,618.28,621.938
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, it does.",623.106,623.569
SPEAKER_00," Well, this might be a good place to wrap this session up.",626.002,629.052
SPEAKER_00, That feels like the right move for you.,631.48,634.297
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,635.738,635.84
SPEAKER_00," And we'll schedule, so I see you next week and we can pick up from there.",637.022,641.599
SPEAKER_01, Sounds good.,641.922,642.289
SPEAKER_01," All right, cool.",643.228,643.595
SPEAKER_00," Thanks, Carl.",643.901,644.228
SPEAKER_01, Thank you.,644.84,645.215
