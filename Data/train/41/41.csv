SPEAKER_01,6.211,10.858," Each of the programs I spent one day, and none of them worked."
SPEAKER_01,12.482,21.672," And it was so frustrating because I took so much time out of my work to go, and I still  couldn't find an appropriate placement for her."
SPEAKER_00,23.58,28.497, My advice would be for you or your daughter to at least spend a week at the program.
SPEAKER_00,29.822,31.457," Again, she needs to get the feel."
SPEAKER_01,31.981,33.047," No, we can't do that."
SPEAKER_01,35.52,38.397," There's no way I can take her, I couldn't drag her back there."
SPEAKER_01,39.041,40.168, Either any of those programs.
SPEAKER_00,41.98,42.91, So what are you looking for then?
SPEAKER_00,43.98,47.258, I need your help to find a program that fits her.
SPEAKER_00,47.66,50.573," If I give you three more programs, will that work?"
SPEAKER_01,52.28,53.219, But what if they don't work?
SPEAKER_01,53.341,54.096, How about if I...
SPEAKER_00,54.28,55.799, You need to give it a chance.
SPEAKER_00,55.92,57.359, You need to go and visit again.
SPEAKER_01,57.583,57.909, I know.
SPEAKER_00,58.521,60.539, And take at least one out of your busy schedule.
SPEAKER_01,60.821,67.614," I actually came across a program which is perfect for her, and I really would like for  you to help me see if this could work."
SPEAKER_01,68.882,76.495, I'd rather for you to try to do that instead of me shopping around for other programs because  so far the ones that have been offered me have not worked.
SPEAKER_00,77.44,82.007," So the program that you're interested in, you want me to go with you, or you want me  to..."
SPEAKER_01,82.64,83.069, I want you...
SPEAKER_00,83.722,84.64, What do you want me to do?
SPEAKER_01,84.76,90.653, I want you to know if I could choose that program instead of one of the others that  you have offered.
SPEAKER_00,91.882,96.859," Okay, well looking at my schedule, it probably won't be until maybe two weeks."
SPEAKER_00,97.04,98.984, My schedule is pretty much tied up.
SPEAKER_00,105.88,109.799," The case just got transferred to me, so I'm not very familiar with your situation."
SPEAKER_01,110.243,110.509, Right.
SPEAKER_01,111.422,112.409,"Well, my daughter's 17 years old."
SPEAKER_01,114.76,116.951," She's actually very high functioning, thankfully."
SPEAKER_01,118.741,121.878, I went to three of these programs and none of them worked.
SPEAKER_00,122.723,124.315, So you're looking for a day program.
SPEAKER_01,125.0,125.102, Right.
SPEAKER_00,126.161,127.916, And something that really is good for your daughter.
SPEAKER_01,128.4,128.89," Right, right."
SPEAKER_01,130.182,136.201," And I was looking for a program that would stimulate her, that she'd really enjoy going  to."
SPEAKER_01,137.16,141.617, But they were either babysitting programs or they were just...
SPEAKER_01,142.32,146.958, The participants were all at different developmental levels so that she couldn't really...
SPEAKER_01,147.44,148.27, She couldn't make friends.
SPEAKER_01,149.963,152.353," Yeah, they were not good for her."
SPEAKER_00,154.04,155.759," While you were there, it was difficult."
SPEAKER_00,155.88,159.96, Your daughter didn't really kind of fit in or connect with anybody while you were visiting.
SPEAKER_01,160.142,161.194," No, she did not."
SPEAKER_01,163.384,168.578, There just wasn't that sense of that common commonality.
SPEAKER_01,169.44,172.119, There was no basis for friendships.
SPEAKER_01,173.24,180.625," There were some young people there who were screaming, yelling, and who were talking to  themselves."
SPEAKER_01,182.52,184.229, And she didn't know how to engage.
SPEAKER_00,186.564,187.473, So just there wasn't...
SPEAKER_00,188.24,189.694," When you visited, they didn't sort of..."
SPEAKER_00,190.28,194.956, The program didn't help you to connect or help your daughter to connect to anything  that was going on.
SPEAKER_00,195.2,197.256, You were just sort of viewing it.
SPEAKER_01,197.882,198.106, Right.
SPEAKER_01,199.902,203.479," I observed for a whole day each of these programs, which was..."
SPEAKER_01,204.127,204.918, It took a lot of time.
SPEAKER_00,205.141,205.529, Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,206.583,208.555, I work full time and I don't...
SPEAKER_01,209.32,212.856, It was very difficult to schedule time to go to these places.
SPEAKER_01,213.86,216.119," Once I did, it was just so disappointing."
