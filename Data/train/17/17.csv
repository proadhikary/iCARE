SPEAKER_00, I'm doing well.,4.0,4.286
SPEAKER_00, Thanks for asking.,5.0,5.347
SPEAKER_00, I was hoping we could start today by beginning your treatment plan.,6.0,7.325
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,11.0,11.082
SPEAKER_00," I don't know if you remember from the first session that I had told you about, but I was  hoping we could start today by beginning your treatment plan.",14.586,23.899
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,24.143,24.816
SPEAKER_00, I don't know if you remember from the first session that I had told you around session  four that we would start your treatment plan and try to finish it around session five.,25.221,36.037
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,37.122,37.408
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,38.02,38.224
SPEAKER_00," So the treatment plan, I usually like the treatment plan to have two or three goals  and each goal has some objectives.",39.0,44.832
SPEAKER_00, So today I thought we'd just work on one goal.,46.0,47.859
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,48.0,48.122
SPEAKER_00, All right.,49.184,49.918
SPEAKER_00, And I'll kind of get that down and then give you some time to think about it until next  week and then kind of work on the other goals from there.,50.281,58.0
SPEAKER_00, We'll finish off the treatment plan next week.,58.222,60.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,60.49,60.714
SPEAKER_01, That sounds good.,61.327,61.98
SPEAKER_00, That sound okay to you?,62.0,62.673
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,63.163,63.694
SPEAKER_00, So the goal is kind of like your overarching goal for therapy in general.,64.201,70.037
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,71.306,71.959
SPEAKER_00, All right.,72.0,72.265
SPEAKER_00, Which I'm going to note too are specific tasks you can do that will help you achieve that  goal.,74.0,81.959
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,82.0,82.082
SPEAKER_00," So they're specific, they're measurable, and we hope they're achievable.",83.06,87.92
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,88.673,88.939
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,89.102,89.918
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,90.061,90.204
SPEAKER_00, So you have like an overall goal in mind for our counseling sessions?,91.201,97.576
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,100.313,100.636
SPEAKER_01," I would like to be able to kind of, I've been feeling a little depressed and I would really  like to be able to reduce those, you know, the depression.",102.0,113.217
SPEAKER_00, So reduce feelings of depression?,114.725,116.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,117.061,117.286
SPEAKER_00, That would be your goal.,118.0,118.653
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,119.163,119.612
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,120.0,120.082
SPEAKER_00, Sounds like a good goal.,121.0,122.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,122.082,122.429
SPEAKER_00," So what objectives, what tasks do you think that you could do that would help you to feel  less depressed?",123.341,134.589
SPEAKER_01," I guess maybe some sort of physical activity, maybe like walking.",141.321,149.0
SPEAKER_01," I like to be outside, so maybe walking could be one.",150.0,154.859
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,155.531,155.735
SPEAKER_00, Have you had a plan before where you've walked regularly?,157.064,160.719
SPEAKER_01," You know, I used to.",161.667,162.677
SPEAKER_01, I did.,163.525,163.848
SPEAKER_01, And it would give me some relief because I was able to clear my mind whenever I was walking.,165.341,172.619
SPEAKER_01," So yes, yes.",174.685,176.376
SPEAKER_01, I've had success with walking before.,177.06,179.275
SPEAKER_00, So walking has worked before?,180.082,181.0
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,181.041,181.102
SPEAKER_00, And you've noticed that you're walking less since you've had a feelings of depression?,182.623,186.0
SPEAKER_01, I have been.,186.388,186.857
SPEAKER_01, I really haven't been doing too much of anything.,187.162,189.0
SPEAKER_01," I've just been kind of at home doing homework, stressing out over getting homework done because  I'm back in school and it's been so stressful and overwhelming.",189.2,204.0
SPEAKER_01," Like I said, it's just kind of got me in this little funk, this depressed mood.",204.08,209.599
SPEAKER_00," Well, since you're on the topic of homework, is there something you think you can do there?",211.486,214.859
SPEAKER_00, You mentioned that it's stressful and overwhelming and that sounds like the type of feelings  that are related to depression sometimes.,215.0,222.497
SPEAKER_00, Do you find that kind of being stressed about the homework is?,224.421,228.656
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, because you know, it's so much work to be done and sometimes I get several assignments  due and at the same time I find myself rushing to get assignments in and you know, it can  just be a little daunting.",230.702,248.919
SPEAKER_01, It's just overwhelming sometimes.,249.041,250.0
SPEAKER_01," So yeah, and I don't know, maybe if I spaced it out and you know, took, you know, did some  time management or something like that, I don't know, to kind of help me with that.",250.261,264.96
SPEAKER_00, So you feel like maybe you're starting the homework late compared to when it's due?,265.0,269.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah.",269.687,270.879
SPEAKER_00," So that's where the feeling, maybe overwhelmed?",271.644,273.98
SPEAKER_01," Yes, I would say that.",274.687,275.737
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,276.102,276.776
SPEAKER_00," So yeah, you're right, it sounds like this is just an organizational thing, right?",277.583,280.98
SPEAKER_00," So if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier and do it in  small bits instead of waiting more or less the last minute, that would reduce, I mean  likely I would think, reduce some of the stress and feelings of being overwhelmed.",281.321,302.438
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I'm sure it would.",303.343,304.939
SPEAKER_00, You sure would.,305.061,305.51
SPEAKER_00, So you want to make that your second objective then?,306.02,307.859
SPEAKER_00, So you have the walking.,308.224,309.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,309.02,309.163
SPEAKER_00, And then you'll have trying to space out the homework.,310.562,315.0
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, okay.",315.02,315.551
SPEAKER_01, That sounds doable.,316.143,316.837
SPEAKER_00, That sound good?,317.0,317.939
SPEAKER_00, All right.,318.02,318.449
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,319.0,319.122
SPEAKER_00," So we have, so we have the walking and then spacing out the homework a little more.",321.103,327.98
SPEAKER_00," So that's two objectives and both of those seem tied to the feelings, to the oppressive  feelings that you're trying to eliminate.",328.04,336.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,337.367,337.612
SPEAKER_00, What other objectives might work?,338.624,339.933
SPEAKER_01, Let's see.,341.626,342.051
SPEAKER_01," You know, since I've been back in school, I just kind of, you know, I used to love to  sing and I haven't done that in a while.",343.742,353.719
SPEAKER_01," And so maybe getting out and singing again and, you know, socializing with my friends  that I used to sing with, maybe that could help because it would get me out of the house,  you know.",354.902,370.343
SPEAKER_00, Has that worked in the past for you?,372.04,373.576
SPEAKER_01," You know, it was something that I enjoyed doing.",374.303,375.859
SPEAKER_01," And right now I feel like I'm not doing any of the things that I've enjoyed doing because  I've been so busy doing work, doing homework.",376.583,383.98
SPEAKER_01, So I think that would probably help.,384.201,387.0
SPEAKER_00," So it's a good break from thinking about, stressing about, as you put it, the homework.",387.762,394.0
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,394.0,394.061
SPEAKER_00, For you.,395.347,395.673
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,396.714,396.796
SPEAKER_00," It has kind of a, I mean the singing part's fun for you it sounds like, but also there's  a social component it seems like.",397.02,402.0
SPEAKER_01," Yes, it is.",402.429,402.918
SPEAKER_01, It is.,403.143,403.388
SPEAKER_01," So I enjoy, like I said, I enjoy singing and, you know, I enjoy the people that I would  sing with and we would go and hang out together, go to different, you know, like jazz clubs  or events, you know, different bands that we're playing at, you know, it would just  be nice.",405.04,419.327
SPEAKER_01, It's fun.,420.02,420.918
SPEAKER_01, So I love music.,421.242,422.879
SPEAKER_01," So I love listening to it and I love, you know, singing.",423.584,426.0
SPEAKER_01, So making music.,426.404,427.939
SPEAKER_01," So that would be, I think that would be a good goal.",428.826,430.859
SPEAKER_00, You seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing.,431.382,434.457
SPEAKER_01," Yes, I just love it.",435.242,436.778
SPEAKER_01, I enjoy doing it and I just haven't had a chance to do it lately.,437.0,439.718
SPEAKER_00, So part of this is just making the time.,440.866,442.96
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,445.041,445.327
SPEAKER_00, Good.,446.796,446.939
SPEAKER_00, All right.,447.0,447.469
SPEAKER_00, So we'll make that a third objective.,448.0,449.919
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,450.245,450.51
SPEAKER_00, So we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently.,451.321,456.197
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,457.02,457.796
SPEAKER_00, And singing and that socializing that accompanies that singing.,458.0,463.819
SPEAKER_00, That's great.,464.0,464.347
SPEAKER_00," So, three objectives is good.",465.525,467.0
SPEAKER_00, I try to get to four if you have one.,467.303,468.778
SPEAKER_00," Is there a fourth objective that you can think of, something else that you associated with  not feeling depressed?",469.02,476.467
SPEAKER_01," Well, I used to absolutely love going to the beach and visiting with my aunt.",479.942,486.799
SPEAKER_01, And so that's two things.,488.067,489.94
SPEAKER_01, The beach.,490.082,490.796
SPEAKER_01, I love the beach because it's soothing.,491.444,492.818
SPEAKER_01, It's comforting.,493.364,494.515
SPEAKER_01," And my aunt, she's just such an awesome person.",495.342,498.0
SPEAKER_01, She's always pouring into me and I just love spending time with her.,498.281,501.618
SPEAKER_00, And she lives down at the beach.,502.889,503.939
SPEAKER_01," Yes, she does.",504.265,505.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,505.388,505.653
SPEAKER_00," So that's, it seems like a good objective too.",506.0,508.678
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,509.041,509.286
SPEAKER_00," So, you're suggesting maybe visiting her more often?",510.341,514.94
SPEAKER_01," Yes, again, just at home doing homework and I haven't gone to visit her.",515.822,522.479
SPEAKER_01, And the thing is she only lives like an hour away.,523.06,525.597
SPEAKER_00, So it's not a huge ride.,526.626,527.98
SPEAKER_01," No, it's not.",528.0,528.592
SPEAKER_01, So that's like a little trip I can do on a Saturday.,529.161,533.92
SPEAKER_01, So I can take a break and go down there and spend some time with her.,534.804,537.337
SPEAKER_01, I think that would be helpful.,538.201,539.409
SPEAKER_00," So again, kind of getting away from the school stressors and kind of just taking a break from it for a day.",541.441,550.539
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,551.592,551.714
SPEAKER_00, And then also spending time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with.,552.0,554.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,555.714,555.939
SPEAKER_00, Good.,559.082,559.224
SPEAKER_00, All right.,560.061,560.408
SPEAKER_00, So I want to go through each one of these.,561.0,561.98
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,562.143,562.51
SPEAKER_00," And make sure that we're kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do.",563.442,567.458
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,568.082,568.714
SPEAKER_00," These are all specific, which is good.",569.0,571.513
SPEAKER_00, Do you feel these are all achievable?,573.141,575.114
SPEAKER_00, These are things you can do?,576.0,576.959
SPEAKER_01, I think so.,577.51,577.939
SPEAKER_01," Yes, I do.",579.102,579.612
SPEAKER_00," Well, some of them you've done in the past, right?",580.0,581.0
SPEAKER_01, Right.,581.265,581.449
SPEAKER_00, So now we have the specific and the achievable.,583.003,588.077
SPEAKER_00," Now I want to get to parts a little more tricky, which is making it measurable.",589.181,592.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,592.082,592.306
SPEAKER_00," What I'd like to do here, and I don't want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives.",593.04,596.98
SPEAKER_00, I want you to decide.,597.204,597.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,598.0,598.122
SPEAKER_00," But I want to see if we can quantify in some manner how often you'll be able to do these different things, or how, you know, like in the homework,  we'll have to think about the spacing would be the quantity.",599.02,611.879
SPEAKER_00, But first with the walking.,612.505,613.636
SPEAKER_01, Right.,614.0,614.306
SPEAKER_00," So in a given week, say, what's realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking?",615.281,619.9
SPEAKER_00, How many times?,620.0,620.622
SPEAKER_01, Maybe I can start out with twice a week.,627.101,630.98
SPEAKER_00, Twice a week.,631.531,632.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,632.04,632.201
SPEAKER_00, Do you have two particular days in mind?,635.525,637.0
SPEAKER_00, Days where your responsibilities aren't too great and you have that opportunity?,637.322,641.0
SPEAKER_01, Maybe we need to start with one day a week.,649.597,650.98
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,651.041,651.184
SPEAKER_00, Let's go with one day a week.,652.286,652.98
SPEAKER_00, Let's go one time.,653.04,654.98
SPEAKER_00, One time a week.,655.0,655.939
SPEAKER_01, Let's start with one and then we'll see what happens.,656.465,658.0
SPEAKER_00, That's a good start.,659.253,659.899
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,660.245,660.653
SPEAKER_00, So what day of the week are you thinking of for walking?,661.02,662.939
SPEAKER_00, How about Monday?,664.365,667.839
SPEAKER_00, Is there a window of opportunity there you see on Monday?,669.463,671.456
SPEAKER_01, It is.,672.265,672.653
SPEAKER_00, Yeah?,673.265,673.408
SPEAKER_01," Plus, it just kind of, I think, well, no, no.",674.281,678.98
SPEAKER_00, How about Wednesday?,679.0,679.878
SPEAKER_01, Wednesday.,680.163,680.571
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,681.367,681.592
SPEAKER_01," Wednesday, middle of the week, stress from work and school and, yes, Wednesday sounds  good.",682.0,688.265
SPEAKER_00, Wednesday.,689.184,689.551
SPEAKER_00," Do you have a particular time range you like to walk, what would be the time of the day?",690.02,692.758
SPEAKER_01, Like 6.30.,693.082,693.224
SPEAKER_00, That's a good time for you?,694.245,695.0
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,695.102,695.796
SPEAKER_00, That's a time you can get out of the house?,696.0,697.0
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,698.061,698.204
SPEAKER_01," Off work and give me a little bit of time to get home and change and out the door because  if I make it too late, I'm not going to go.",699.642,709.839
SPEAKER_01," So 6.30 is kind of a good, that's the good time to get out there.",711.668,713.96
SPEAKER_00," Yes, 6.30.",714.0,714.061
SPEAKER_00, All right.,715.755,715.939
SPEAKER_00, Good.,716.0,716.143
SPEAKER_00," So we'll start with that objective, the walking.",717.121,719.98
SPEAKER_00, Every Wednesday at 6.30.,720.646,721.273
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,722.041,722.245
SPEAKER_00, And for every amount of time you're comfortable with.,723.926,725.436
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,726.469,726.735
SPEAKER_00, So the homework.,728.143,728.918
SPEAKER_00, This is a little trickier.,729.263,731.0
SPEAKER_01, All right.,731.122,731.98
SPEAKER_00, So this is about spacing it out.,732.0,733.657
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,734.02,734.367
SPEAKER_00," So the homework assignments, they're stressing it out.",735.101,737.96
SPEAKER_00, How much time do they take?,738.404,739.818
SPEAKER_00," Well, I'll ask you a few questions.",740.747,741.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,742.796,742.98
SPEAKER_00, How much time do they take to complete generally?,743.0,744.717
SPEAKER_00," Like in hours, so.",745.323,746.394
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,747.163,747.286
SPEAKER_01, It depends on the assignment.,748.606,749.899
SPEAKER_00, Have you had the average?,750.102,750.98
SPEAKER_01," The average, maybe about two hours, two and a half hours, I guess.",751.742,759.94
SPEAKER_00," Well, let's go with the worst case.",760.082,761.0
SPEAKER_00, Let's go two and a half hours just to cover the worst case.,761.161,764.0
SPEAKER_00, Would that generally be the worst case?,764.384,765.96
SPEAKER_01," I think so, maybe.",766.765,768.195
SPEAKER_01," It depends because of, yeah.",769.626,770.838
SPEAKER_00, Want me to get three?,771.122,771.918
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, let's make it three.",772.082,772.755
SPEAKER_00," And then how much time do you have from when it's assigned to when it's due, usually?",775.141,779.88
SPEAKER_01, Maybe a couple of weeks.,780.802,788.0
SPEAKER_00, A couple of weeks?,788.06,791.859
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,792.02,792.245
SPEAKER_00, All right.,793.0,793.286
SPEAKER_00, And what have you been doing now in terms of managing those three hours relative to  that two-week period?,794.543,798.98
SPEAKER_00, Like it doesn't sound like you're doing it early in the two-week period.,799.502,803.639
SPEAKER_01," No, I'm not.",804.0,804.878
SPEAKER_00," Yeah, so a little bit later?",805.0,805.694
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,806.02,806.347
SPEAKER_01," I get distracted, so I get a little distracted.",807.422,810.899
SPEAKER_01," So it's, you know, I start reading and I'll fall asleep or I get distracted by something  or, and then before you know it, the time is gone and I'm rushing at the end to try  and get it all done.",811.161,825.857
SPEAKER_01, Two hours with the work.,826.02,827.0
SPEAKER_01, Three hours.,827.163,827.592
SPEAKER_00, Three hours with the work.,828.02,829.0
SPEAKER_00," Squeezed into the last, okay.",829.0,830.657
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,831.0,831.265
SPEAKER_00, I could see how that would be stressful.,832.02,833.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,833.143,833.694
SPEAKER_00, What day of the week is it usually assigned?,834.04,836.185

SPEAKER_00, On Tuesdays.,843.163,843.653
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,844.265,844.531
SPEAKER_00, All right.,845.163,845.755
SPEAKER_00, So you have Tuesday and then you have another Tuesday and then the week after that is due.,846.0,850.96
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,851.204,851.51
SPEAKER_00, You have three hours of work in those two weeks.,852.0,856.355
SPEAKER_00, So let's look at it this way maybe.,858.04,859.691
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,861.102,861.939
SPEAKER_00," What time could you set aside, say near that first Tuesday, that you could put maybe the  first hour in?",862.14,869.576
SPEAKER_00, Maybe divide it in three parts?,870.0,870.939
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,871.388,871.694
SPEAKER_00, Is that enough parts?,872.0,872.98
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, it should be.",874.374,875.0
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,875.367,875.612

SPEAKER_0q," Right, right.",884.0,884.306
SPEAKER_00, How about the time when you could start the homework?,885.04,886.98
SPEAKER_00, If it's the first hour.,887.404,888.273
SPEAKER_01, Maybe after I've come back from my walk on Wednesdays.,890.347,892.678
SPEAKER_00, How long do you foresee a walk?,893.041,893.98
SPEAKER_01, Normally I only walk for an hour.,894.181,895.812
SPEAKER_00," So give you some time to decompress maybe around 8, 8 o'clock.",897.02,900.779
SPEAKER_00, All right.,901.143,901.531
SPEAKER_00," So from 8 to 9 on Tuesday, on Wednesday, I'm sorry.",902.02,904.839
SPEAKER_01, Wednesday.,905.143,905.469
SPEAKER_00," On Wednesday, you'll get that first third of your homework.",906.181,909.317
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,910.265,910.51
SPEAKER_00, And then you'll stop.,911.061,911.633
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,912.061,912.265
SPEAKER_00, That'll be that for the night.,913.306,914.0
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,914.0,914.122
SPEAKER_00, All right.,915.265,915.51
SPEAKER_00, Does that sound like a plan?,916.122,917.0
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,917.0,917.245
SPEAKER_01, What's the second hour?,918.0,922.759
SPEAKER_00," Maybe a few days, give yourself a few days.",923.0,924.253
SPEAKER_01," No, I guess I could start it Thursday.",925.281,933.379
SPEAKER_00, Thursday?,934.041,934.551
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,935.0,935.163
SPEAKER_00, So that's just one day apart.,936.041,936.939
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,937.714,937.857
SPEAKER_00, You want to make yourself more time?,938.0,938.959
SPEAKER_00, It seems like you're not sure.,939.06,946.98
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,947.02,947.143
SPEAKER_01, Let's do Thursday.,948.02,949.0
SPEAKER_00, You want to go Thursday?,949.286,949.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,950.02,950.224
SPEAKER_00, In an hour?,951.0,951.98
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,952.041,952.286
SPEAKER_00, And what hour do you have in mind?,953.0,957.779
SPEAKER_01," Thursdays, about 7 o'clock.",958.08,961.638
SPEAKER_00, So about 7 to 8?,962.886,963.691
SPEAKER_01, 7 to 8.,965.286,965.571
SPEAKER_00, All right.,966.082,966.653
SPEAKER_00," So one night, Wednesday, it'll be 8 to 9, it's your walk.",968.126,969.995
SPEAKER_00," And then on Thursday, 7 to 9.",971.0,972.025
SPEAKER_01," Well, that's two hours.",975.505,976.293
SPEAKER_00," 7 to 8, sorry.",977.121,977.848
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,979.469,979.592
SPEAKER_00, So now just the last hour remains.,980.02,981.717
SPEAKER_00, Sunday.,982.122,982.551
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,983.102,983.306
SPEAKER_00, Sunday.,984.0,984.327
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,988.061,988.184
SPEAKER_00, So you want to get everything done from Tuesday to Sunday night.,989.02,991.839
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,992.224,992.388
SPEAKER_00, And have the rest of that time off.,993.02,994.0
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,994.0,994.286
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,995.02,995.245
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,996.163,996.286
SPEAKER_00, Are you sure that's achievable?,997.0,997.918
SPEAKER_00, That seems like you're getting a lot in there.,999.43,1000.96
SPEAKER_00, Do you think you can do it?,1001.303,1002.111
SPEAKER_01, I'll get dry.,1003.0,1003.857
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,1004.265,1004.449
SPEAKER_00, That sounds good.,1005.0,1005.633
SPEAKER_00, All right.,1006.347,1006.673
SPEAKER_00, What time Sunday?,1007.0,1007.98
SPEAKER_01, Sunday around 5.,1008.04,1009.03
SPEAKER_00, So 5 to 6?,1010.102,1010.388
SPEAKER_01," 5 to 6, yes.",1011.263,1011.505
SPEAKER_00," And I'm assuming it won't run over because we kind of asked me on the high side, but  if it did, would you be able to go 5 to 7?",1013.161,1019.497
SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.,1020.102,1020.347
SPEAKER_00, So that's kind of like flexible time there.,1021.02,1023.114
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1024.082,1024.49
SPEAKER_00, So what would that feel like to get your homework done by Sunday?,1025.0,1026.616
SPEAKER_01, It would be a relief.,1027.323,1028.596
SPEAKER_01," And then I could do some other stuff like, you know, maybe my next goal.",1030.0,1034.016
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1035.082,1035.367
SPEAKER_00," So, and there's a potential backup plan I see in here is that if something happens on  Sunday, where you need more time and you don't want to stress, you still have that Wednesday  after you walk, bacon.",1036.401,1048.0
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,1048.0,1048.265
SPEAKER_00, So that could be like your backup.,1049.041,1049.959
SPEAKER_00, Yes.,1050.02,1050.143
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,1051.041,1051.694
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1052.429,1052.592
SPEAKER_00, Because you still have another six days to have done after that.,1053.0,1054.973
SPEAKER_00, Right.,1056.429,1056.592
SPEAKER_00, Does that seem realistic and achievable?,1057.0,1058.657
SPEAKER_01, It does.,1059.163,1059.857
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1060.0,1060.327
SPEAKER_00, So how about the singing?,1061.0,1061.735
SPEAKER_01," I have no idea how long the singing thing takes, so.",1062.0,1064.171
SPEAKER_01," Well, if I get back in the group that I was in, we would normally get together on a Friday  after work.",1066.682,1074.706
SPEAKER_00," Every Friday, every so many Fridays?",1076.224,1078.717
SPEAKER_01, Every Friday.,1079.723,1080.814
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,1083.082,1083.592
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1084.449,1084.571
SPEAKER_01," So on Fridays, it would just be rehearsal.",1085.0,1086.616
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1087.082,1087.306
SPEAKER_01," And then another Friday, it would be a shorter rehearsal, and then we would go someplace  if we knew of a group of some friends of ours that were performing.",1088.502,1098.294
SPEAKER_00," So this is an every Friday commitment, right, the singing?",1100.281,1104.0
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1104.51,1104.837
SPEAKER_01," But one Friday is generally, it's like the end, about two hours.",1105.0,1110.0
SPEAKER_00, About two hours.,1110.122,1110.939
SPEAKER_00, So two hours every Friday.,1111.626,1112.838
SPEAKER_00," This is something you really enjoy, though.",1113.02,1114.0
SPEAKER_01, It is.,1114.163,1114.653
SPEAKER_00, So it sounds like you look forward to it.,1115.202,1116.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1117.041,1117.102
SPEAKER_00, All right.,1119.0,1119.49
SPEAKER_00," So Friday, two hours, I guess, would be the afternoon or evening?",1120.0,1122.995
SPEAKER_01, Evening.,1124.224,1124.51
SPEAKER_00, All right.,1127.102,1128.0
SPEAKER_00, So that's one that you would kind of look forward to.,1128.703,1132.538
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1133.286,1133.408
SPEAKER_01, The singing.,1134.592,1134.939
SPEAKER_00, That's good.,1135.082,1135.449
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1136.041,1136.633
SPEAKER_00, So that's one you feel you could achieve a couple hours on Friday.,1137.161,1139.557
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,1141.0,1141.122
SPEAKER_01, So I think it was something that came up that I really had to get done.,1142.0,1144.758
SPEAKER_01, It's not like I can't not go.,1145.705,1147.597
SPEAKER_00, So...,1148.367,1148.531
SPEAKER_00, It won't be managed or anything?,1149.041,1149.959
SPEAKER_01, No.,1150.0,1150.082
SPEAKER_01, They know I'm in school.,1152.0,1153.0
SPEAKER_01," In school, they understand.",1153.02,1153.857
SPEAKER_00, Good.,1155.041,1156.0
SPEAKER_00, So then there's the last objective.,1157.02,1158.0
SPEAKER_00," This is, I guess, about a whole day commitment, right, because you go to the beach.",1158.623,1161.859
SPEAKER_01, That would be more like a Saturday.,1169.505,1170.98
SPEAKER_00, But of course it wouldn't be every Saturday.,1171.624,1173.396
SPEAKER_00," So how many times in, say, a month?",1174.04,1176.698
SPEAKER_00, Like once?,1177.102,1177.857
SPEAKER_01, Once a month.,1178.286,1178.714
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1181.531,1181.776
SPEAKER_00, So you would go down on Saturday morning and come back that same day?,1182.582,1188.94
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1189.041,1189.265
SPEAKER_00, Is that something you look forward to?,1190.707,1191.717
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1192.02,1192.224
SPEAKER_00," Is that something that would be okay in terms of like, because on Friday night potentially  you'd be out, right?",1193.06,1199.859
SPEAKER_00, And then Saturday.,1200.082,1200.776
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,1201.735,1201.918
SPEAKER_01," But if I, if on those Saturdays that I know that I'm going, I could not be out too late  on that.",1202.1,1208.837
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,1209.776,1209.959
SPEAKER_00, That's a good idea.,1210.041,1210.612
SPEAKER_00, So you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out.,1211.06,1213.497
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1214.388,1214.469
SPEAKER_00, When you know that Saturday's coming.,1215.0,1216.0
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1216.082,1216.163
SPEAKER_00, Or not go at all that Friday.,1217.404,1218.616
SPEAKER_00, Either way.,1219.0,1219.245
SPEAKER_00, Just take a break that time.,1220.041,1220.98
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1221.102,1221.224
SPEAKER_00, Re-store.,1223.265,1223.551
SPEAKER_01, All right.,1224.469,1224.735
SPEAKER_00, So that's four separate objectives.,1225.0,1226.192
SPEAKER_00," And what I want to do since I've kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want  to take a moment, just take a break and print this up for you.",1227.321,1236.899
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1237.143,1237.408
SPEAKER_00," We'll work on the rest of your goals next time, but I want you to have this so you can  get started on it right away.",1238.141,1244.091
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1245.306,1245.429
SPEAKER_00," So before I print these up, is there any changes you want to make?",1246.0,1247.95
SPEAKER_01, No.,1250.939,1250.98
SPEAKER_01," I would like to try that and if it doesn't work, can we tweak it?",1252.286,1254.96
SPEAKER_00, Oh yeah.,1255.204,1255.694
SPEAKER_00, Just make changes.,1256.0,1256.469
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1257.694,1257.878
SPEAKER_00, Maybe certain things will work really well.,1258.0,1259.394
SPEAKER_00, Maybe certain things will have to take off the list altogether and maybe substitute something  else.,1260.02,1264.306
SPEAKER_00," But yeah, we can make edits to it the whole time you're here.",1265.0,1267.98
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1268.0,1268.122
SPEAKER_00, We can just make a document that changes as needed.,1269.02,1271.416
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,1272.0,1272.082
SPEAKER_00," But if you think it's a good starting place, I'll go ahead and print this up as it is and  give you a copy and we can resume with today's session and then next time I see you in a  week, we'll work on the rest of the treatment plan.",1273.361,1287.0
SPEAKER_01, Sounds good.,1287.0,1287.918
SPEAKER_00, Does that sound like a good plan?,1288.02,1289.253
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,1290.429,1290.592
SPEAKER_00, Thanks Alison.,1291.347,1291.796
SPEAKER_01, Thank you.,1292.0,1292.02
