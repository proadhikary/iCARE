SPEAKER_00," Hey Rhonda, how are you doing today?",14.799,15.54
SPEAKER_01, I'm fine.,16.131,16.438
SPEAKER_00, You're fine?,17.131,17.499
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,17.825,18.029
SPEAKER_00, I'm glad you could come in today for this intake.,19.324,22.338
SPEAKER_00, I want to explain a little about the process.,23.505,25.237
SPEAKER_00, I understand you've already completed the informed consent.,26.244,28.299
SPEAKER_01, Yes.,28.787,29.032
SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I've done this before.",29.88,30.778
SPEAKER_01, You've done this before?,30.88,31.553
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,32.513,32.615
SPEAKER_00, So you understand my obligations to report certain things.,32.88,34.653
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,36.07,36.315
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,36.662,37.54
SPEAKER_00, So you answered some other questions in that packet that you filled out with the informed  consent.,37.62,43.729
SPEAKER_00, It's actual type questions.,45.386,46.613
SPEAKER_00," Information might be on your driver's license or insurance card, things like that.",48.02,51.116
SPEAKER_00, I'm going to be asking you more emotionally oriented questions as part of this part of  the intake.,51.94,60.96
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,61.45,61.572
SPEAKER_00, All right.,62.511,62.756
SPEAKER_00, Some of the topics we'll be covering are sensitive for many people and you may not want to talk  about it and that's okay.,62.96,69.638
SPEAKER_01, All right.,70.148,70.515
SPEAKER_00," So if I stumble upon one of those topics, you know, I discuss it, just let me know and  we don't have to talk about it.",70.8,78.018
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,78.935,79.139
SPEAKER_00," If there's an area that you don't want to talk about right now but you want to talk  about later, we can talk about it later.",79.54,84.855
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,85.764,86.07
SPEAKER_00, Does that make sense?,86.601,87.213
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,87.744,87.866
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,89.397,89.519
SPEAKER_00, So how are you referred here to our agency?,89.56,91.976
SPEAKER_01," Well, I have this friend that I've known her forever and she told me that she was really  concerned about the way I was living my life and that, you know, I should be coming here.",92.821,103.439
SPEAKER_01," So as a favor to her, I'm here.",103.56,105.073
SPEAKER_00, All right.,106.572,106.858
SPEAKER_00, So you're here as a favor to your friend.,107.04,108.608
SPEAKER_00, Do you feel committed to counseling?,110.84,114.9
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I guess there's some things I can work on, but I mean, they have problems that  I really just don't have.",116.203,123.569
SPEAKER_00," And when you say they, who are you referring to?",125.946,128.72
SPEAKER_01," Some of my other friends, the friend that referred me.",128.72,130.933
SPEAKER_00, All right.,132.992,133.418
SPEAKER_00," So there's some elements that they're observing and reporting to you, but you're not quite  seeing them.",133.56,141.55
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,142.04,142.122
SPEAKER_00, And you think they might not be there at all?,143.342,144.653
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,145.825,145.968
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,146.56,147.499
SPEAKER_00, Fair enough.,147.56,147.864
SPEAKER_00, So I want to talk about what we refer to as the presenting problem.,149.081,153.976
SPEAKER_00," I know you indicated you're here because a friend referred you, but in terms of the,  any symptoms or any problems, issues that might be going in your life, are any of those  you can identify, you could talk about?",155.621,169.457
SPEAKER_01," Well, I mean, I will admit I do get angry a lot.",169.84,173.238
SPEAKER_00, Anger?,173.802,173.985
SPEAKER_01, Okay.,174.904,175.067
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,175.72,175.904
SPEAKER_01," And sometimes when I get mad, I break a few things.",176.72,179.459
SPEAKER_01," I'll punch a wall, I won't hit anybody.",179.56,182.278
SPEAKER_01," So I mean, that's not a problem, you know, but I'll take it out on something that doesn't  feel pain.",182.64,189.089
SPEAKER_01, I thought that was a good thing.,189.721,191.479
SPEAKER_00, So inanimate objects are the target of some physical and angry behavior.,192.862,199.96
SPEAKER_00, Yeah.,200.305,200.469
SPEAKER_00, But not people.,201.04,201.632
SPEAKER_01," No, not people.",202.04,202.909
SPEAKER_00, So do you view anger as a problem you want to work on?,203.92,208.316
SPEAKER_01, I guess I could work on being less angry.,209.581,211.737
SPEAKER_01," I don't think I have a anger problem, but I can be less angry.",212.16,216.735
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,218.12,218.281
SPEAKER_00, So one of the symptoms would be anger.,220.44,224.597
SPEAKER_00," You don't necessarily feel like it's a large problem, but you could be less angry.",225.36,230.44
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,230.642,231.275
SPEAKER_01, You'd be okay.,231.602,231.928
SPEAKER_01," I mean, I think everybody can work on being a little more peaceful.",232.52,234.594
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,235.663,235.867
SPEAKER_00, That makes sense.,236.52,237.52
SPEAKER_00, Anything else?,237.52,237.949
SPEAKER_01," Now, this is something I have tried to stop before, but I'm having a problem.",240.447,243.639
SPEAKER_01, I do smoke marijuana a lot.,244.1,246.919
SPEAKER_01, I'm not even going to lie to you.,247.883,248.998
SPEAKER_01, A lot.,249.202,249.385
SPEAKER_01," Um, and recently I've been getting into like snorting some drugs.",250.763,254.599
SPEAKER_00, Can you tell me what drugs?,256.03,256.918
SPEAKER_01, Like Xanax.,257.16,257.763
SPEAKER_01," And I've tried to stop before and it didn't work, but I mean, I like it.",260.84,266.059
SPEAKER_01, So it's kind of like that.,266.4,268.216
SPEAKER_01, Do I really want to give it up?,269.285,270.274
SPEAKER_01, I don't know.,271.103,271.715
SPEAKER_01, Sure.,272.082,272.94
SPEAKER_00, You seem a little more torn on that.,272.96,275.479
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,275.741,275.925
SPEAKER_00, So you say a lot of marijuana.,277.661,279.429
SPEAKER_00, And that can mean something different depending on the person.,282.28,284.279
SPEAKER_00, What's it mean to you?,284.4,284.966
SPEAKER_01, Several times during the day.,286.16,287.25
SPEAKER_01," Even when I'm at work, I'll go to my car on break.",288.4,290.472
SPEAKER_00, Does anybody notice that?,292.0,292.89
SPEAKER_01," I mean, the place I work at isn't very professional, I guess.",293.92,297.818
SPEAKER_01," I mean, there are managers that I hide it from, but everybody there pretty much knows.",298.28,302.173
SPEAKER_00, They're okay with it.,305.124,305.892
SPEAKER_00, And you mentioned specifically Xanax and Benzodiazepine.,307.443,311.057
SPEAKER_00, Any other drugs?,311.84,314.058
SPEAKER_01," Uh, no.",315.088,315.351
SPEAKER_01, It's just mainly the marijuana and then I've started the Xanax.,317.705,321.418
SPEAKER_00, That seems like it's more recent.,322.14,323.195
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,323.622,324.03
SPEAKER_01," I mean, within the past four months, a friend introduced it to me and started to like it.",324.52,329.214
SPEAKER_00, How often do you use that?,331.24,333.44
SPEAKER_01," About once less often, I'd have to say about maybe twice every weekend.",333.76,341.058
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,341.801,341.923
SPEAKER_00, And the marijuana sounds more like an everyday thing.,343.324,345.376
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,346.123,346.838
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,347.327,347.776
SPEAKER_00, Any other drugs?,347.96,348.96
SPEAKER_00, Pretty much it?,349.062,349.94
SPEAKER_01, No.,349.96,350.001
SPEAKER_01, No more drugs.,351.021,351.715
SPEAKER_00, All right.,352.593,352.797
SPEAKER_00, How about in your past?,352.98,353.878
SPEAKER_01," In my past, I have experimented with cocaine, but I kind of got in trouble with the DUI  for that.",354.161,362.47
SPEAKER_01, Had to stop that.,363.501,364.113
SPEAKER_00, All right.,364.644,364.909
SPEAKER_00, Anything else?,366.175,366.44
SPEAKER_00, No.,366.481,366.542
SPEAKER_01, No.,367.93,368.113
SPEAKER_00, Any other problems you identify to work on?,369.144,371.716
SPEAKER_01," Um, I can sometimes let my pride get in my way.",373.003,375.154
SPEAKER_00, Pride?,376.726,376.889
SPEAKER_00, Tell me a little bit about that.,377.44,378.065
SPEAKER_01, I don't like being told I'm doing something wrong.,379.801,382.64
SPEAKER_01," Because most of the time I'm not or I'm doing it in a way, like just because I'm not doing  it your way doesn't mean I'm doing it wrong.",383.062,388.831
SPEAKER_01, I know what I can do and I know what I'm capable of.,390.58,393.674
SPEAKER_00, All right.,395.243,395.607
SPEAKER_00, So is somebody telling you that you're acting in a way that's proud?,396.84,401.537
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,402.706,402.91
SPEAKER_01, I've had several people.,403.866,404.717
SPEAKER_01," I've lost a few friends because over, you know, little things that I won't budge on.",404.96,411.395
SPEAKER_01," For example, things like, you know, like what the best TV show is.",413.4,419.158
SPEAKER_01, I know what the best TV show is and anybody who says any different is wrong.,419.82,422.814
SPEAKER_01, But I've lost friends.,424.12,424.807
SPEAKER_01, But you know what?,426.12,426.875
SPEAKER_01, Maybe they're not real friends.,427.12,429.2
SPEAKER_00," So you're indicating pride, but it sounds like maybe inflexibility is a part of it too.",429.42,436.398
SPEAKER_01, I guess.,437.181,437.508
SPEAKER_00, Has anybody ever said that to you?,438.564,439.655
SPEAKER_01," I mean, not in that word, but I mean, now that you say it, I guess, yeah.",440.18,444.133
SPEAKER_00, You think that's kind of together with the pride?,446.08,448.275
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,449.082,449.306
SPEAKER_00," You feel like, okay.",450.0,451.8
SPEAKER_00," Is that a fair adjective, inflexible?",451.8,454.997
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,455.541,456.031
SPEAKER_00, Okay.,456.909,457.378
SPEAKER_00, All right.,458.811,459.174
SPEAKER_00," So we have anger, mostly the objects though.",459.92,463.538
SPEAKER_00, Not at people.,464.344,464.808
SPEAKER_00," Marijuana, a lot.",466.02,467.67
SPEAKER_00," Xanax, not as much.",469.28,470.752
SPEAKER_01, Occasionally.,471.883,472.434
SPEAKER_00, Occasionally.,472.761,473.455
SPEAKER_00, And then inflexibility and pride.,474.524,477.297
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,477.961,478.124
SPEAKER_00, Does that sound like an accurate?,479.122,480.153
SPEAKER_01," I mean, yeah, that really would.",480.921,482.557
SPEAKER_00, Accurate list.,482.901,483.33
SPEAKER_01, Not that I hate to admit it.,483.881,484.84
SPEAKER_01, It does.,484.983,485.452
SPEAKER_00, So it's tough for you to talk about this part?,485.88,488.176
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,488.843,489.068
SPEAKER_01, Yeah.,489.909,490.118
