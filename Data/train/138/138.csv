SPEAKER_00,44.367,57.836," All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because, as you know, we have a zero tolerance  policy for drugs and alcohol at this school, and as athletic director, it's my job to check  in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule."
SPEAKER_00,58.82,78.633," And I've been hearing some chatter from some of the other kids about a party this weekend,  and from what I hear, you were there, and I can't confirm or deny anything, so I'm not  at the point where I can give you consequences, but I do want to talk to you about whether  or not you're drinking and how you really can't be doing this as a member of one of  our teams."
SPEAKER_01,79.04,83.052," Right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this  past weekend."
SPEAKER_01,83.78,86.158," Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student."
SPEAKER_01,86.44,95.692," I usually am studying over the weekend, and my parents don't let me go out to parties,  but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that  my friends were pressuring me to go to."
SPEAKER_01,96.82,112.076," And when I got there, I'm not used to this party environment where everything that you  see in the movies is kind of what happens, where you have people just drinking out of  the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason."
SPEAKER_01,113.78,122.193," Because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone  else was doing, so I wouldn't be ostracized."
SPEAKER_00,123.882,124.311, I get it.
SPEAKER_00,125.465,126.896," We've all been there, okay?"
SPEAKER_00,127.561,128.911," I was in high school once, too."
SPEAKER_00,130.222,131.016," I drank, too."
SPEAKER_00,131.322,131.689, I get it.
SPEAKER_00,132.22,134.839," There's not a ton to do in this town, and kids drink."
SPEAKER_00,135.923,141.934," But the problem is we have these rules, and if you're on a team, you have to stick by  the rules."
SPEAKER_01,144.141,146.018, I know that it's bad for me.
SPEAKER_01,146.28,147.015, It's bad for my body.
SPEAKER_01,147.32,150.378," It's bad for being on a team, for being an athlete."
SPEAKER_01,150.72,151.7, It hinders my performance.
SPEAKER_01,151.74,153.619, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,153.961,156.839, I feel that my friends pressure me.
SPEAKER_01,157.205,157.552, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,158.0,160.979," I feel I should go with different friend groups, maybe."
SPEAKER_01,161.182,161.59, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00,162.1,162.917," Chris, come on."
SPEAKER_00,163.08,164.08, You're getting peer pressure.
SPEAKER_01,164.427,164.794, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01,165.662,170.94," Being in a sports team, you have to be unified with the group."
SPEAKER_00,171.282,172.555," Yeah, but you're one of the leaders."
SPEAKER_01,173.94,183.515," Right, and as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be ... expect  them to lead not only in the sports, but also in social environments."
SPEAKER_01,184.901,187.778," If that's social, that's a social custom in our society."
SPEAKER_00,189.525,192.477," Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker, then."
SPEAKER_01,193.34,199.508," I could, but that could also backfire on me, I feel, that I could be ridiculed for having  a stick up my butt."
SPEAKER_00,200.8,201.739, You're a star player.
SPEAKER_00,201.962,202.84, Who's going to pick on you?
SPEAKER_01,202.88,205.437," I mean, I'm just one person."
SPEAKER_01,207.75,209.136, It's the voice of the mob.
SPEAKER_00,209.88,215.24," Yeah, so the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking."
SPEAKER_00,215.482,217.159, I can't be hearing that you're at parties.
SPEAKER_00,217.702,220.171, I can't be seeing pictures on Facebook.
SPEAKER_00,222.56,226.875," There are rules at this school, and in my job, I have to enforce them."
SPEAKER_00,228.2,229.19," Like I said, I get it."
SPEAKER_00,230.363,231.2, I understand.
SPEAKER_00,231.702,232.559, I know what it's like.
SPEAKER_00,232.943,234.676, I get that you want to have fun.
SPEAKER_00,235.2,236.172, Your teenage years.
SPEAKER_00,237.563,240.698," I get that, but you are a star player."
SPEAKER_00,241.08,242.448, We want to keep you on the team.
SPEAKER_00,244.32,246.112, We got to figure out a way to get through this.
SPEAKER_01,248.424,251.234," Well, I'll dedicate the time not to party."
SPEAKER_01,253.12,260.288," Not party, but you get involved with alcohol to that extent, and have it publicized on  the internet."
SPEAKER_00,261.887,262.56, What do you mean?
SPEAKER_01,262.56,264.07," Like on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw on the internet."
SPEAKER_01,265.6,276.366, I'll avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually  drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time put on the internet so others  can see.
SPEAKER_00,277.631,277.998, All right.
SPEAKER_00,278.522,282.419," Yeah, I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're going to be on the team, okay?"
SPEAKER_01,282.6,282.743, Right.
SPEAKER_01,284.212,284.58, I will stop.
SPEAKER_00,284.6,285.58, All right.
SPEAKER_00,285.6,286.029, You promise?
SPEAKER_01,286.743,287.294, I promise.
SPEAKER_00,287.702,288.539, All right.
SPEAKER_00,288.6,288.763, Shake?
SPEAKER_01,289.927,290.212, Shake.
SPEAKER_00,291.402,292.034, We'll see you later.
SPEAKER_01,292.402,292.993, See you later.
SPEAKER_00,293.422,293.973, All right.
